Although there are many methods for SAR images registration, their performance will decrease between SAR and optical images. Moreover, these algorithms suffer from lack of matching pairs of the feature points and uneven distribution between SAR and optical images. Therefore, they cannot accurately achieve the registration between optical and SAR images. To solve the above deficiencies, we propose an efficient image registration approach based on SAR and optical image-scale invariant feature transform (SOI-SIFT). Firstly, a linear edge enhancement based on gray feature and histogram equalization is introduced. In this stage, we enhance the edge features of the image so that the number of image feature points can be greatly increased. Then, for feature points purification, we use fast sample consensus algorithm to filter duplicate and wrong matching feature points. SOI-SIFT can be more adapted to the heterogeneous image matching. Experimental results have shown the superiorities of the proposed method. © 2022 IEEE."

However, there are still issues such as resource imbalance and unreliable identity when collaborative nodes provide computing and caching services for computing devices. Therefore, an efficient and reliable MEC network should be established to manage these challenges. In this paper, a dynamic trusted collaboration scheme is proposed. Specifically, the transaction supervision of nodes in the MEC scenario is first realized through blockchain-based mobile edge computing (BMEC) technology. In BMEC, a management scheme is established laying the foundation for building a trusted MEC environment. Second, a collaborative model is designed. On this basis, it is formulated as an optimization problem based on computing, communication, caching, and energy consumption. The formulation problem is verified to be NP complete. Thus, an improved heuristic algorithm is adopted in this study to solve this problem. Ultimately, the experimental results demonstrate that DTC not only has good performance but also can effectively enhance the reliability of the MEC network compared with other cooperative schemes. © 2022 IEEE."

In this vision paper we propose Triabase, a novel permissioned blockchain database system that carries out machine learning on the edge, abstracts machine learning models into primitive data blocks that are subsequently stored and retrieved from the blockchain. As such, it does not store detailed records on a medium, like blockchains, which is fundamentally very slow due to the expensive verification process. We lay out the primitive architectural blocks of our design, the requirements and the inherent challenges. Triabase employs technical novelties in respect to its consensus protocol, namely the notion of Proof-of-Federated-Learning (PoFL). The Triabase prototype system is implemented in the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework, upon which encouraging preliminary findings have been drawn. © 2021 IEEE."

In consensus protocols, erasure coded replication has appealing storage and network cost savings compared with full copy replication, which help achieve low latency, high fault-Tolerance and high throughput. However, the liveness level will inevitably decrease when erasure codes are naively applied in consensus protocols. To keep the original liveness level, an existing protocol, called CRaft, switches from erasure coded replication to full copy replication when the number of failures exceeds a certain threshold. Such a solution, however, degrades system performance sharply. To tackle this problem, this work proposes a novel protocol called HRaft to enable graceful degradation on storage and network efficiency when failures happen. Without using full copy replication, it replenishes some coded blocks in healthy servers to reduce storage and network costs and to keep data consistency. The performance of the proposed protocol will be evaluated by deploving it into practical networks. © 2021 IEEE."

Therefore, this paper proposes a high-resolution optical and SAR image registration method using local self-similar descriptor based on edge feature. Firstly, a Gauss-Gamma bi-windows algorithm is used to extract the edge intensity maps of the images respectively. Its function is to eliminate the non-linear gray-scale difference between SAR and optical images, and also to avoid the interference of isolated speckle noise on feature point extraction. Then, local self-similar descriptor is extracted on the edge intensity map, and descriptor matching is performed using Euclidean distance. Finally, the fast sample consensus algorithm is used to eliminate mismatched point pairs. The experimental results can effectively resist speckle noise and radiation differences, and obtain pixel-level registration accuracy. © 2020 IEEE."

But no one is ready to slow down just yet. We can view Gordon Moore's observation on transistor densification as just one aspect of a longer-term underlying technological trend - the Law of Accelerating Returns articulated by Kurzweil. Arguably, companies became somewhat complacent in the Moore era, happy to settle for the gains brought by each new process node. Although we can expect scaling to continue, albeit at a slower pace, the end of Moore's Law delivers a stronger incentive to push other trends of technology progress harder. Some exciting new technologies are now emerging such as multichip 3D integration and the introduction of new technologies such as storage-class memory and silicon photonics. Moreover, we are also entering a golden age of computer architecture innovation. One of the key drivers is the pursuit of domain-specific architectures as proclaimed by Turing award winners John Hennessy and David Patterson. A good example is the Xilinx's AI Engine, one of the important features of the Versal™ ACAP (adaptive compute acceleration platform) [1]. Today, the explosion of AI workloads is one of the most powerful drivers shifting our attention to find faster ways of moving data into, across, and out of accelerators. Features such as massive parallel processing elements, the use of domain specific accelerators, the dense interconnect between distributed on-chip memories and processing elements, are examples of the ways chip makers are looking beyond scaling to achieve next-generation performance gains. Next, the growing demands of scaling-out hyperscale datacenter applications drive much of the new architecture developments. Given a high diversification of workloads that invoke massive compute and data movement, datacenter architectures are moving away from rigid CPU-centric structures and instead prioritize adaptability and configurability to optimize resources such as memory and connectivity of accelerators assigned to individual workloads. There is no longer a single figure of merit. It's not all about Tera-OPS. Other metrics such as transfers-per-second and latency come to the fore as demands become more real-time; autonomous vehicles being an obvious and important example. Moreover, the transition to 5G will result in solutions that operate across the traditional boundaries between the cloud and edge and embedded platforms that are obviously power-conscious and cost-sensitive. Future workloads will require agile software flows that accommodate the spread of functions across edge and cloud. Another industry megatrend that will drive technology requirements especially in encryption, data storage and communication, is Blockchain. To some, it may already have a bad reputation, tarnished by association with the anarchy of cryptocurrency, but it will be more widely relevant than many of us realize. Who could have foreseen the development of today's Internet when ARPANET first appeared as a simple platform for distributed computing and sending email? Through projects such as the open-source Hyperledger, Blockchain technology could be game-changing as a platform for building trust in transactions executed over the Internet. We may soon be talking in terms of the Trusted Internet. The predictability of Moore's law may have become rather too comfortable and slow. The future requires maximizing the flexibility, agility, and efficiency of new technologies. With Moore's Law now mostly behind us, new adaptable and scalable architectures will allow us to further provide exponential return from technology in order to create a more adaptable and intelligent world. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author."

This has led to quicker innovations, agile businesses, availability of new services over the internet, improved collaboration, and better security. With the growth of new technologies like blockchain, quantum computing, mobility-focused applications, and edge computing, there has been an increased interest in adopting cloud services. In this paper, we highlight the different sustainability metrics and benefits while migrating workloads from the on-prem data center to the public clouds. Also, the clouds are elastic, scalable, cost-efficient, robust, and overall a better alternative to host the client applications and services. We present how the major Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) are continuously working on improving their infrastructure for a more energy efficient cloud. But with so many factors like the cost of cloud services, the location of the data center to name a few, it becomes quite a tedious task for the clients to select a cloud service provider when moving from their on-premise data center(s). Hence, we also briefly propose our solution that we are currently working on the final goal is to have a cross-platform advisory that based on a wide-range of client-based inputs and a rich repository of current energy efficient clouds and their sustainability metrics, aims to provide them a detailed recommendation about their preferred cloud service provider. In case the client does not provide any such preference, the advisory should also recommend an ideal cloud service provider for their particular workload. This suggested action will be able to fulfill the client's constraints as well as provide them an energy efficient cloud along with a sustainability score. This score is indicative of how much improvement in the energy consumed and carbon footprint can be achieved through this migration to the suggested cloud. © 2020 ACM."

With ample amount of data, the decision of a person can be predicted using machine learning algorithm. Different types of data for a person can be collected however medical data is considered to be the most valuable one. To enable safe and secure transportation of Medical data from different locations, many algorithms are developed. In this work, the efficacy of transferring Patient Healthcare Information (PHI) using two different encryption standards namely Advanced Encryption Standards (AES) and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman(RSA) is compared. Further, the AES and RSA algorithms are coded inside Raspberry PI hardware using open source Python software. Also, the Raspberry PI is used a fog computing device to encrypt the PHI data. Results demonstrate that the proposed fog device is capable of encrypting PHI data using two different crypto algorithms namely AES and RSA. Also, it is observed that the performance of AES algorithm is better when compared to RSA algorithm.. © 2020 IEEE."

A major open question is whether cryptocurrencies are fundamentally able to support as much traffic as traditional, centralized solutions. One prominent approach for improving the scalability of blockchains is payment channel networks (PCNs) [1]. Instead of committing every transaction to the blockchain, a separate overlay network (called a PCN) is maintained. Each node represents a user, and each edge (or payment channel) represents pre-allocated funds that can be efficiently transacted between the two endpoints under a mutual agreement. Users can transact with each other by relaying payments over a sequence of channels. © 2020 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s)."

Patients, their families, and clinicians face a wide range of complex and often confusing choices regarding their health and health care concerns and require trustworthy information to decide which options are best for them. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) strives to fund clinical comparative effectiveness research, guided by patients, caregivers, and the broader health care community, that will provide high-integrity, evidence-based information to help people make informed health care decisions. This mission is well aligned with the IOM's recent conceptual framework and corresponding recommendations that recognize that addressing the needs of patients with cancer and their families is the most important component of a high-quality cancer care delivery system. PCORI seeks the opportunity to partner with diverse interdisciplinary research teams who demonstrate a strong commitment to the inclusion and engagement of patients and stakeholders as they work to develop high-quality cancer care delivery systems.

The feature detection section adopts Harris-Laplace combined with ROEWA, which is effective to suppress the false alarm on high-contrast areas of SAR image. Moreover, the feature description adopts the GLOH by ROEWA method, since the phase method of GLOH descriptor is robust to rotation.

The investigated types include sinus rhythm, asystole (Asys); supraventricular tachycardia (Tachy); ventricular flutter or fibrillation (VF/VFL); ventricular tachycardia (VT). Methods: 13s limb lead ECG chunks from MIT malignant ventricular arrhythmia database (VFDB) and MIT normal sinus rhythm database were partitioned into subsets for 5-fold cross validation. These signals were resampled to 200Hz, filtered to remove baseline wandering, projected to 2D gray spectrum and then fed into a deep network with brand-new structure. In this network, a feature vector for a single time point was retrieved by residual layers, from which latent representation was extracted by variational autoencoder (VAE). These front portions were trained to meet a certain threshold in loss function, then fixed while training procedure switched to remaining bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN), the very portions to predict an arrhythmia category. Attention windows were polynomial lumped on RNN outputs for learning from details to outlines. And over sampling was employed for imbalanced data. The trained model was wrapped into docker image for deployment in edge or cloud. Conclusion: Promising sensitivities were achieved in four arrhythmias and good precision rates in two ventricular arrhythmias were also observed. Moreover, it was proven that latent representation by VAE, can significantly boost the speed of convergence and accuracy. © 2018 IEEE."

Participants reached consensus regarding the following: (1) Mechanisms are needed to improve the coordination of policy and oversight activities, given overlapping responsibilities for transplantation and clinical investigation among federal agencies. Innovative clinical trials span traditional administrative boundaries and include stakeholders with diverse interests. Participants identified the need for a governmental interagency working group to coordinate nationwide transplant-related activities. (2) Improvements are required in clinical metrics for transplantation, with alignment of performance goals across transplantation organizations and any development of data requirements being consistent with those goals. Database coordination among clinical centers, organ procurement organizations, regulatory agencies, and payers would facilitate research and better inform policy. New data requirements should provide actionable insights into clinical performance. (3) Innovative research seen as potentially adversely affecting Program-Specific Reports may reduce centers’ participation. Cutting-edge research requires mitigation of risk-aversive behaviors created by reporting of clinical outcomes data. Participants proposed a new review process in advance of implementation of clinical trials to guide “carve-outs” of transplant center outcomes data from Program-Specific Reports.

Of necessity, we must posit a recording format. It will consist of a system of cycles which support very high information content and are, furthermore, commonly found as protein polymer structures within the membranes of all our cells. There seems to be consensus that our sensations, ideas, and memories are really just active networks of neurons in our brains [17]. We have a good idea where in the brain specific kinds of mental activity occur, e.π. [4, 10] But, to our knowledge, no one has any idea as to what kinds of networks correspond to any specific sensation, concept or memory. We represent these networks as undirected graphs (N,E) where N is a set of nodes, or neurons, and E is the set of connections, or edges. The concept of neighborhood, that is those nodes, or neurons, connected to a specific node y and denoted y.n, is central to our approach A node y is said to be closed if there is no node z ∈ y.n such that z.n ⊆ y.n. If we assume that information is represented by such neighborhood connections, then z can represent no more information than y, and its neighborhood. We say its role can be subsumed by y, and thus deleted with little loss of information. A network in which every node y is closed is said to be irreducible. © 2018 Authors."

One solution is to offload DNN computations from the client device to nearby edge servers [1] to request an execution of the DNN computations with their powerful hardware. However, there are several issues with the solution. One is an availability issue that how we can provide the edge server with some incentives to run the client' apps. The other is a scalability issue that how we can use more servers when there are more DNN requests. Finally, there is an integrity issue that how the client can trust the result coming from anonymous edge servers. We think the blockchain technology can solve these issues to make edge computing more practical. This paper proposes a novel architecture for DNN edge computing based on the blockchain technology.

Among different approaches, tree-based partitioning is reported to define homogeneous regions rigorously, without ad-hoc adjustments, in a computationally efficient manner. One of the shortcomings of tree-based partitioning is the so-called chaining problem that results in sub-optimal regions. We propose a consensus-based regionalization approach to address the chaining problem associated with a single tree, in particular the minimum spanning tree, by exploring a wide range of partitions via a set of random spanning trees (RST). We propose an algorithm, namely SKATER-CON, that partitions spatial data via a consensus-based framework from an ensemble of regionalizations defined by its deterministic counter-part, the SKATER algorithm applied along stochastic search paths defined by RSTs. SKATER-CON utilizes evidence accumulation to represent an ensemble of regionalizations as a similarity graph. The similarity graph represents spatial objects as vertexes and frequency at which objects are assigned to the same region in the ensemble as edge weights. Proposed algorithm determines consensus among different regionalization by partitioning the similarity graph using a multi-level graph partitioning algorithm (METIS). Spatial constraints are imposed on the similarity graph prior to partitioning to ensure spatial constraints are reflected in the consensus result. We rigorously test the quality of regions produced by SKATER-CON on a large, synthetically generated dataset. The synthetic dataset is the result of full-factorial experiments designed on number, fuzziness, geometry and size of regions. Same dataset is also used compare our approach against state-of-the-art regionalization algorithms (SKATER and ARISEL). Lastly, we show the value added by SKATER-CON compared to SKATER on a real-world dataset based on Ecological Marine Units (EMU) dataset. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

To date, however, there is not a lightweight and secure privacy-preserving solution for video surveillance systems. The recent success of blockchain (BC) technologies and their applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) shed a light on this challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight, Blockchain-based Privacy protection (Lib-Pri) scheme for surveillance cameras at the edge. It enables the VSS to perform surveillance without compromising the privacy of people captured in the videos. The Lib-Pri system transforms the deployed VSS into a system that functions as a federated blockchain network capable of carrying out integrity checking, blurring keys management, feature sharing, and video access sanctioning.

Information generated by the edge device, regardless of the methodology of obtaining, lacks the security in transmitting it to the cloud. In this paper, a hybrid and secure algorithm is proposed for the transmission and storing of the data in the cloud. The proposed algorithm enables the edge device to encrypt the data generated using Advanced Encryption Standard(AES) before transmitting to cloud. The key of the AES is encrypted by using RSA crypto system. The RSA encrypted key is exchanged with the authorized person via electronic mail. The encryption at the edge device is carried out on Field Programmable Gate Array(FPGA) in order make the system independent stand-alone cryptosystem.

Many optical and SAR registration methods have been proposed. But most of them are for lowto-medium resolution images, and less for high-resolution images. Therefore, this paper proposes a high-resolution optical and SAR image registration method using local self-similar descriptor based on edge feature. Firstly, a Gauss-Gamma bi-windows algorithm is used to extract the edge intensity maps of the images respectively. Its function is to eliminate the non-linear gray-scale difference between SAR and optical images, and also to avoid the interference of isolated speckle noise on feature point extraction. Then, local self-similar descriptor is extracted on the edge intensity map, and descriptor matching is performed using Euclidean distance. Finally, the fast sample consensus algorithm is used to eliminate mismatched point pairs. The experimental results can effectively resist speckle noise and radiation differences, and obtain pixel-level registration accuracy."

Moreover, the feature description adopts the GLOH by ROEWA method, since the phase method of GLOH descriptor is robust to rotation.

One solution is to offload DNN computations from the client device to nearby edge servers [1] to request an execution of the DNN computations with their powerful hardware. However, there are several issues with the solution. One is an availability issue that how we can provide the edge server with some incentives to run the client' apps. The other is a scalability issue that how we can use more servers when there are more DNN requests. Finally, there is an integrity issue that how the client can trust the result coming from anonymous edge servers. We think the blockchain technology can solve these issues to make edge computing more practical. This paper proposes a novel architecture for DNN edge computing based on the blockchain technology.

With the booming of edge computing technology, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based delivery system is expected to achieve higher efficiency and low latency. However, the UAV often collects user-specific data during the delivery process, the data-leakage or security/privacy breaching could occur during the data-sharing process between the edge nodes and UAV devices. Privacy-preserving issues are further refraining from the popularity of the UAV-based logistic systems. It is believed that the UAV tracking and identity verification system can provide imminent access-level security and privacy protection, which is urgently required to eliminate the practical concerns under the edge computing-based environment. To the best knowledge of authors, for the first time, this paper proposes a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) integrated framework with the latest Blockchain technology for UAV-based delivery system.

In this work, the benefits of using SSI with Blockchain technology are analyzed, the efficiency of identifying and authenticating UAVs and their respective users is further experimented and discussed.

The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for health and well-being is rapidly increasing in the majority of high-income countries. The interest about telehealthcare allows the provisioning of various kinds of health-related services and applications over the Internet. There are several benefits associated with tele-healthcare, including: the reduction of infection risk due to optimized patients access to clinical centers; optimized healthcare workflows; containment of hospital costs; increased patient safety; improves in the quality of life of both patients and their families. Common telehealthcare applications include tele-nursing, tele-rehabilitation, tele-dialog, tele-monitoring, tele-analysis, tele-pharmacy, tele-care, tele-psychiatry, tele-radiology, tele-pathology, teledermatology, tele-dentistry, tele-audiology, tele-ophthalmology, etc. In the past ten years, key enabling technologies (KETs) such as Internet of Things (IoT), tools for big data management and processing, Cloud/Edge/Fog computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain reached an advanced maturity, and therefore the potential for revolutionizing the whole tele-healthcare sector."

While the majority of the public have a favorable view of surveillance in terms of crime deterrence, individuals do not accept the invasive monitoring of their private life. To date, however, there is not a lightweight and secure privacy-preserving solution for video surveillance systems. The recent success of blockchain (BC) technologies and their applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) shed a light on this challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight, Blockchain-based Privacy protection (Lib-Pri) scheme for surveillance cameras at the edge. It enables the VSS to perform surveillance without compromising the privacy of people captured in the videos. The Lib-Pri system transforms the deployed VSS into a system that functions as a federated blockchain network capable of carrying out integrity checking, blurring keys management, feature sharing, and video access sanctioning. The policy-based enforcement of privacy measures is carried out at the edge devices for real-time video analytics without cluttering the network."
