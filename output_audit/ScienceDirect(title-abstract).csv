The sudden emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the drawbacks in our healthcare systems to handle public health emergencies. It is clear that implementing cutting-edge technology such as blockchain can aid in reducing the devastating effects of healthcare mishaps and promote efficient planning operations and resource deployment. In the healthcare sector, blockchain technology has the potential to improve clinical trial data management by minimizing regulatory approval delays and revitalizing communication between various parties in the supply chain, among other things. Furthermore, the propagation of misinformation has accelerated in recent years, and existing platforms lack the ability to verify the accuracy of data, resulting in public alarm and irrational behavior. As a result, building a blockchain-based tracking system is critical to ensuring that any data related to healthcare are collected in an accurate and trustworthy manner. Blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger distribution technology that can make data processing, provenance, and authentication simpler and has the potential to disrupt healthcare. Blockchain is being actively explored in the health sector to optimize business processes, lower costs, improve patient quality, improve compliance, and make better use of data relevant to healthcare. Nevertheless, the need to ensure that blockchain design elements consider specific healthcare needs from the different viewpoints of clients, patients, providers, and regulators is crucial in determining whether blockchain will fulfill the excitement of a technology described as ``revolutionary'' and ``disruptive.'' In addition, blockchain approaches must also be attentive to the specific problems facing healthcare relative to other sectors of the economy, in response to the actual needs of healthcare stakeholders. There have been many proposed implementations of blockchain in the healthcare sector, such as electronic health record (EHR) systems. In this chapter, we review the motivations of inculcating blockchain in currently existing EHR systems. The content of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 1 discusses a brief introduction of blockchain along with the EHR system and the current implementation of blockchain in the medical industry. The second section provides a deeper insight into the importance of mobile health, remote monitoring, and the motivations for using blockchain-based EHR systems. The third section will cover the details of a patient-centered blockchain model along with its promising features. The development of the COVID-19 pandemic has created a slew of difficulties around the world. The use of blockchain technology is critical in developing a platform for effectively managing the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of a precise mechanism to detect new infections and anticipate the coronavirus infection risk is the largest difficulty facing most nations. The numerous characteristics of blockchain technology, such as decentralization, transparency, and immutability, can aid in pandemic management by detecting breakouts early, expediting drug distribution, and safeguarding user privacy while undergoing treatment. In this chapter, we examine blockchain applications and potential in the fight against COVID-19, demonstrating that the proposed solution is cost-effective and assures data integrity, security, transparency, and traceability among stakeholders during the pandemic. The last section is the conclusion.","Blockchain, Healthcare, Electronic health record system, Security, Privacy, COVID-19",,

With the increasing number of IoT users and devices, the demands for secure communication and data confidentiality are getting higher and higher, and the identity authentication and access control of IoT devices has become a huge challenge. In the IoT environment, the traditional device identity and access management methods based on public key infrastructure (PKI) and blockchain bring the problems of single point failure and scalability. The emergence of decentralized storage system and distributed ledger technology directed acyclic graph (DAG) provide new ideas to solve these problems. In the paper, we use distributed ledger technology IOTA with low energy demand to design a lightweight and scalable mechanism to manage the identity of IoT devices and access control of large-scale IoT data, so as to ensure source reliability and sharing security of IoT data. In the new scheme, IOTA technology is used to realize the functions of registration, update, revocation and retrieval of the identity of IoT devices, which solves the defects caused by centralized management. Inter planetary file system (IPFS) is used to store a large amount of data generated by devices in the IoT, which not only reduces the burden on devices and systems of IoT, but also solves the single point of failure, delay and other problems caused by traditional cloud storage. At the same time, the fog node is used to provide localized computing for a group of IoT devices to solve the problem of limited computing resources of IoT devices. In addition, in order to prevent data abuse caused by unauthorized devices accessing network resources, a trusted access control mechanism is designed to achieve fine-grained access control, access policy update and other functions, so as to better maintain the IoT environment and network security. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through simulation experiments, and the security and functions of the scheme are analyzed, which proves that the scheme meets the security demands of the IoT environment.","Internet of Things, IOTA, IPFS, Fog computing, Identity management, Access control, Security",,

In this paper, we illustrate the use of these technologies for the implementation and deployment of a practical use case in the white appliances industry. Specifically, we present how a sorter component can be automatically programmed in order to ensure that items arriving at a conveyor are optimally placed in various bays. The use case leverages the edge computing paradigm in order to ensure that each physical item is able to communicate its status to all the others. At the same time, distributed ledger technologies enable the modelling of the sorting process as a reliable smart contract among all physical entities.

In this paper, we propose a smart-toy-edge-computing-oriented data exchange prototype using Hyperledger Fabric v1.0. We target to solve the issue of automatically maintaining a tamper-resistant, reliable and distributed ledger by writing smart contract in the environment where the participants are distrustful of each other.

Despite substantial amounts of effort invested in the area, there has been very little actual deployment of mechanisms to guarantee QoS in the Internet. As a result, the Internet is largely operating on a ``best effort'' basis in terms of QoS. Here, we attempt a historical overview in order to better understand how we got to the point where we are today and consider the evolution of QoS/QoE in the future. As we move towards more demanding networking environments where enormous amounts of data is produced at the edge of the network (e.g., from IoT devices), computation will also need to migrate to the edge in order to guarantee QoS. In turn, we argue that distributed computing at the edge of the network will inevitably require infrastructure decentralisation. That said, trust to the infrastructure provider is more difficult to guarantee and new components need to be incorporated into the Internet landscape in order to be able to support emerging applications, but also achieve acceptable service quality. We start from the first steps of ATM and related IP-based technologies, we consider recent proposals for content-oriented and Information-Centric Networking, mobile edge and fog computing, and finally we see how distributed Internet governance through Distributed Ledger Technology and blockchains can influence QoS in future networks.","QoS, QoE, Mobile edge computing, Fog computing, Distributed ledger technology, Blockchain",COMCOM 40 years,

We observed that Ethereum is the most used DLT. Fit-for-purpose technologies like IOTA and concepts like Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) were underrepresented.

For instance, cost-efficient scheduling, security, and data validation in distributed hospitals to share their data. In this paper, we devise bio-inspired robotics-enabled schemes in the blockchain-fog-cloud-assisted IoMT environment. The goal is to minimize execution cost and blockchain of applications. Based on the proposed system, the study devises bio-inspired robotics function blockchain task scheduling (BIR-FBTS) schemes, determining the optimal assignment of tasks to the available nodes.

Specifically, we design a three-tier architecture-based data aggregation framework by integrating fog computing and the blockchain, which provides strong support for achieving efficient and secure data collection in smart grids. Subsequently, we develop a secure and anonymous data aggregation mechanism with low computational overhead by jointly leveraging the Paillier encryption, batch aggregation signature and anonymous authentication. In particular, the system achieves fine-grained data aggregation and provides effective support for power dispatching and price adjustment by the designed double-blockchain and two-level data aggregation.

Privacy-preserving and data security challenges are among the many concerns impeding the goal of making data storage available and processing at the edge of the network quite difficult to implement. Authenticated users must be the only ones with access to their respective stored data which are protected against any form of intruder manipulation. Most authentication schemes proposed and implemented in edge computing and other paradigms use a trusted entity to initialize the authentication process between edge servers and prospective users. Servers and users are expected to register with the trusted party first before they are able to subsequently authenticate one another. The presence of the trusted party presents scalability issues as well as the threat of having a single point of failure which may threaten the availability of the entire network. In this paper, we present a fully decentralized approach to solving this problem by eliminating the public trusted entity within the network framework termed DecChain. In DecChain we employ some notable principles of permissioned blockchain technology in the rollout and authentication of elements within the network. Authenticated users within our proposed framework would not have to sign in to every service provider to be authenticated to access a service or resource. Security experiments and the deployment of our scheme are carried out to evaluate the performance of DecChain. The results show our scheme is secured and achieves the intended purpose efficiently.","Blockchain, Edge computing, Security, Scalability, Authentication, Decentralized",,

Specifically, the paper affords the conclusion that in most instances of home automation, a potential topological place to start the blockchain is in the home gateway that supports the processing and computing required to aggregate or in-network-preprocess the data flows from the various appliances; however, the computing and storage requirements may limit this deployment paradigm to a subset of cases. Alternatively, the place to start the blockchain could be in the fog-to-core gateway point, but in this case this process does not fully guarantee end-to-end integrity. The actual Proof of Work (PoW) functionality would likely be in the core network and not in the relatively low computing-power home gateway. Another alternative envisions private local blockchains to be instituted in the home area network, but still not necessarily for all appliance-generated transactions due to the large volume of such status, event, and usage data.","Home automation, Domotics, IoT, IoT gateways, Middleware bridges, UPnP, UPnP Cloud, ZigBee, Bloothooth Mesh, Blockchains, Proof or work",Special Issue of the Elsevier IoT Journal on Blockchain Applications in IoT Environments,

It has started to participate in almost every aspect of our social life, ranging from financial transactions to the healthcare system, communication to national security, battlefield to smart homes, and so on. However, the wide deployment of IoT suffers certain issues as well, such as interoperability, compatibility, heterogeneity, large amount of data, processing of heterogeneous data etc. Among others, energy efficiency and security are the utmost prominent issues. Scarce computing resources of IoT devices put hindrances on information sharing across edge or IoT network. Indeed, unintentional or malicious interference with IoT data may lead to severe concerns. In this study, the researcher exploits the potential benefits of a blockchain system and integrates it with software-defined networking (SDN) while justifying energy and security issues. More in detail, the researcher proposed a new routing protocol with the cluster structure for IoT networks using blockchain-based architecture for SDN controller. The proposed architecture obviates proof-of-work (PoW) with private and public blockchains for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communication between SDN controllers and IoT devices. In addition to this, distributed trust-based authentication mechanism makes blockchain even more adoptive for IoT devices with limited resources.

The key objectives are to improve the computation and processing of drone-based resource constraints and deliver the data to the outsourced computational node to schedule, process, manage, optimize, and preserve it since they are located close to each other through a wireless sensor network. This collaborative technological approach to robustness is the standard of drone system design and implementation, reducing the computational power, resource consumption, and latency for the application that needs a fast response. However, recent research into fog-enabled drone-based data management and optimization poses a serious challenge in terms of privacy, security, and preservation. On the other hand, Blockchain Hyperledger Technology, which is mostly used in Bitcoin Cryptocurrencies, has been applied in a large number of distributed applications due to the ledger integrity, transparency, trustworthiness, provenance, reliability, availability, protection, and security-related distributed features that are provided. Therefore, the distributed application of drone control has received more attention because of its ability to handle collaborative procedures to capture, schedule, process, optimize, manage, and preserve drone-based data using fog nodes and blockchain hyperledger technology. In this paper, we proposed a collaborative approach using blockchain hyperledger fabric and a metaheuristic-enabled genetic algorithm for fog node management called B-Drone. This approach handles drone-based data collection, scheduling, optimizing, processing, managing, and preservation in a secure manner in the fog node. The protection of each transaction between drone and fog node before exchange is private with the utilization of the hash-encryption (SHA-256) algorithm.

Devices such as blood-pressure monitors, glucose meters, heart monitoring implants, Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), and Electromyography (EMG) wearable devices allow health providers to collect the patient health information locally and make a real-time decision based on the Patient Health Data (PHD). Hospitals have been adopting the IoT for many years and now they have healthcare IoT devices in patients' rooms and their bodies. However, the medical agencies, hospitals, and companies do not consider the security risk of healthcare IoT devices connected to a Local Area Network (LAN) or Wide Area Network (WAN). The IoT devices can be easily hacked and may lead to several potentially life-threatening risks due to poor authentication and encryption practices. Existing machine learning algorithms and blockchain approach working in the cloud computing environment are unable to meet the Quality of Service (QoS) like reliability, authentication, identification, and security requirements of healthcare IoT devices. Most of the traditional machine learning algorithms and techniques for healthcare IoT lacks the real-world implementation for secure data transmission. Therefore, blockchain is introduced for secure and reliable transaction in healthcare IoT. Whereas Fog Computing (FC) is introduced to extend the services of the cloud at the edge of networks. Integration of FC with blockchain can overcome the issue of healthcare IoT device identification, authentication, and verification for scalable frequent data transmission in a decentralized environment. Hence, a novel solution for the abovementioned problem is proposed using FC and blockchain. It includes an FC-based three-tier architecture, an analytical model, a mathematical framework, and an Advanced Signature-Based Encryption (ASE) algorithm for healthcare IoT device identification, verification, and Patient Health Data (PHD) authentication. The aim is to extend secure data transmission for healthcare IoT and end-users availing the real-time services. The proposed model and algorithm will be able to provide services for transaction and transmission near the edge in a secure manner. By analyzing the generated results from the proposed novel ASE algorithm for throughput, packet error, reliability, and malicious node detection accuracy; it is observed that the ASE algorithm in the FC environment easily outperforms the cloud and the other existing state of the art techniques such as FogBus, Femto cloud, Blockchain Fog-based Architecture Network (BFAN), and BeeKeeper. The malicious node detection accuracy of the ASE algorithm in the FC environment is 91% and in the cloud is 83%. Whereas the reliability percentage of the ASE algorithm in FC is 95% and in the cloud is 87%. The proposed approach is tested on simulators iFogSim (Net-Beans) and SimBlock.","Healthcare, Internet-of-Things, fog computing, blockchain, cloud computing, edge computing, encryption, decryption, ring, symmetric key, asymmetric key, security, Diffie-Hellman, signature, cryptography",,

However, the limited battery power of mobile devices limits access to abundant data. To address this problem, an energy-efficient and secure algorithm should be introduced to reduce energy consumption for the MFBC. In this paper, an energy-efficient and secure hybrid (EESH) algorithm is introduced for the MFBC to support the IoT. The EESH algorithm uses the voltage scaling factor to reduce energy consumption. The performance of the EESH algorithm is substantially better than the state-of-the-art contending algorithms when the number of IoT-tasks increases, and EESH consumes minimal energy. Furthermore, the identity of mobile cloud users is of paramount significance; therefore, the EESH is further secured by applying a malicious data detection (MDD) algorithm using blockchain technology. The capability of the processors on the server side of the MFBC is analyzed and improved for the IoT. The proposed EESH, MDD and underlying algorithms are programmed on the Java platform.

However, when using blockchain technology, the proof-of-work completed by vehicles may consume substantial energy and computing resources, which limits the application of blockchain technology in the internet of vehicles environment. Therefore, this paper considers deploying edge computing nodes to support blockchain technology and introducing an auction mechanism to encourage users to record vehicle driving data as miners. This paper proposes two auction mechanisms for the blockchain network formed by edge computing service providers and miners to maximize the social welfare. Specifically, one mechanism is used when the resource demands of the miners are the same, and the other is used when the resource demands of the miners are different. For resource allocation, the former uses the maximum cost maximum flow algorithm to achieve optimal allocation, and the latter uses a heuristic algorithm. For price payment, the former uses the Vickrey--Clarke--Groves mechanism, and the latter uses dichotomy. These two price payment algorithms use critical value theory to calculate the payment price. This paper demonstrates that both are truthful and individually rational. Through experiments, this paper evaluates indicators such as social welfare, satisfaction, and resource utilization. The experiments show that the proposed auction mechanism can effectively maximize social welfare in the blockchain network and provide an effective resource allocation strategy for edge computing service providers.","Blockchain, Internet of vehicles, Edge computing, Resource allocation, Mechanism design",,

Thereby, amounts of edge devices are accessed to the City IoT leading to the computation resources explosion and security issues in the smart environment.

By leveraging network-assisted device-to-device (D2D) collaboration, resource-constrained mobile devices are able to offload computation tasks to nearby resource-sharing mobile devices. Meanwhile, blockchain technology is developing rapidly and has been applied to mobile scenarios with massive information interaction for establishing trust between mobile devices. However, the computing power of mobile devices is limited by the physical size and battery capacity, which is not enough to cope with the high computation overhead for blockchain mining process. Thus, offloading mining tasks to the edge servers becomes a viable option. This paper investigates both of the D2D task offloading problem and the mining task offloading problem in a blockchain-enabled beyond 5G network. For the purpose of efficient resource allocation, the former is formulated as a double auction market and the latter is formulated as a Stackelberg game. Moreover, we propose two pricing based schemes to solve these two computation offloading problems, among which Bayes-Nash equilibrium and Stackelberg equilibrium are analyzed. At last, by comparison with the benchmark, the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed schemes are evaluated.

With the rapid increase of MCS data throughput, traditional cloud platforms can no longer meet the huge data processing needs. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an MCS federated learning system based on Blockchain and edge computing. This paper uses federated learning as the framework of the MCS system. The system protects data privacy and location privacy by using the Double local disturbance Localized Differential Privacy (DLD-LDP) proposed in this paper. Because the sensed data exists in multiple modalities (text, video, audio, etc.), this paper uses the Multi-modal Transformer (MulT) method to merge the multi-modal data before subsequent operations.

A reputation calculation method (Sig-RCU) is proposed to calculate the real-time reputation of task participants. Through conducting experiments on real data sets, the effectiveness and adaptation of the proposed DLD-LDP algorithm and Sig-RCU algorithm are verified.","Mobile crowdsourcing, Privacy protection, Blockchain, Edge computing, Federated learning, Localized Differential Privacy",,

Moreover, existing security mechanisms are faced with the issue of monitoring and collecting historic data throughout the entire IoT network of the smart city in order to deliver optimal security and defense against cyberattacks.

When using evolutionary algorithms to solve this problem, each individual usually represents the mining decisions and resource allocations of all miners, which results in the redundant search space due to the fact that not all miners participate in mining. In this paper, we propose a new differential evolution (DE) algorithm, called DEMiDRA. In DEMiDRA, each individual represents the resource allocation of a participating miner and the resource allocations of all participating miners constitute the whole population. Then, DE is adopted to optimize the resource allocation. As for the optimization of the mining decision, we need to select miners to participate in mining and update the number of participating miners. Since the population size is equal to the number of participating miners, we transform the update of the number of participating miners into the adjustment of the population size and design an adaptive strategy. Besides, a tabu strategy is developed to prevent unpromising miners from participating in mining. The effectiveness of DEMiDRA is verified by comparing it with three other algorithms on a set of instances.","Blockchain, Mobile edge computing, Differential evolution, Encoding, Mining decision, Resource allocation",,

However, we should address several challenges to facilitate the end-users finding and consuming the relevant services from the edge at the Internet scale. First, the scale and diversity of the edge hinder seamless access. Second, a framework where researchers openly share their services and data in a secured manner among themselves and with external consumers over the Internet does not exist. Third, the lack of a unified interface and trust across the service providers hinder their interchangeability in composing workflows by chaining the services. Thus, creating a workflow from the services deployed on the various edge nodes is presently impractical. This paper designs Viseu, a latency-aware blockchain framework to provide Virtual Internet Services at the Edge. Viseu aims to solve the puzzle of network service discovery at the edge, considering the peers' reputation and latency when choosing the service instances. Viseu enables peers to share their computational resources, services, and data among each other in an untrusted environment, rather than relying on a set of trusted service providers. By composing workflows from the peers' services, rather than confining them to the pre-established service provider and consumer roles, Viseu aims to facilitate scientific collaboration across the peers natively. Furthermore, by offering services from multiple peers close to the end-users, Viseu also minimizes end-to-end latency and data loss in the service execution at the Internet scale.","Peer-to-peer networks, Blockchain, Edge",,

Nonetheless, the current drone-based systems have some limitations, such as the need for humans in control of large-scale drones, drone's energy inefficiency, repercussion of quality of service (QoS) from abnormalities events, shortages of automaticity and real-time interactions, deficiency of swift decisions from artificial intelligence-based SAR, and underestimation of security issues in SAR systems. Therefore, developing a more advanced drone-based system is necessary to overcome these limitations. However, it is challenging to achieve the target due to trade-off relationships of technologies and strict requirements of time-critical SAR. This paper studies the feasibility of an Internet-of-Drones (IoD) system using blockchain and artificial intelligence at the edge to overcome limitations and improve SAR QoS. An advanced IoD system architecture from drones to a back-end system and end-users terminals has been proposed. Furthermore, advanced edge services and artificial intelligence at the edge have been presented for automatically searching for missing persons. In addition, computation offloading approaches have been provided to improve the energy efficiency of drones and reduce system latency. Last but not least, public and private blockchain, including Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, for providing secure and decentralized healthcare platform has been investigated and analyzed to enable real-time interaction between healthcare entities and improves healthcare services. The results show that the proposed system helps overcome the limitations and improve the SAR QoS. Besides, the proposed system satisfies the security requirements, including confidentiality, integrity, authentication, authorization, access control, privacy, trust, transparency, availability, automaticity, and tolerance.","Internet-of-Drone (IoD), Edge computing, Blockchain, Search and Rescue (SAR), Energy efficiency, Computation offloading",,

To address the limited processing capabilities of edge devices, create a block chain-based huge data sharing architecture in cooperative edges. Then, for high computational reduction, propose a Proof-of-Collaboration consensus technique, in which edge devices participate in block formation by giving their PoC credits. Furthermore, a useless transaction filter technique was proposed for transaction offloading, drastically decreasing the block chain's storage space in edges. Comprehensive tests are carried out to illustrate our proposal's better performance.

Security vulnerabilities remain possible owing to easy, direct and spontaneous interactions between untrusted users as well as mobility. In this article, we establish a Secure D2D Caching framework inspired on trUst management and Blockchain (SeCDUB) to improve the security of D2D communication in video caching, through an approach that combines direct and indirect observations. In addition, blockchain concepts were adapted to the dynamic and restricted scenario of the D2D networks to prevent data interception and the alteration of indirect observations. Two uncertainty mathematical models were used to infer direct and indirect trust values: Bayesian inference and the Dempster Shafer Theory (DST) respectively. In addition, we have designed a clustering scheme that enables a faster and more lightweight blockchain for D2D networks. This ensures overhead will not increase with the number of nodes, and thus offers a scalable security solution. Although the average throughput and packet loss increase when SeCDUB is employed, it is not significant in dense scenarios.

We propose two software agents: Software agent for Network formation and Monitoring (SAN) and Software agent for Blockchain formation and monitoring (SAB) placed in the fog node where SAN forms/monitors the network of IoT devices and SAB implements the security framework for blockchain implementation. Here, three different versions of AES (128/192/256) are used for group key sharing. Group key is used for encryption/decryption of the data present in a block of a blockchain. An AES 128 based Proof of Work (PoW) is used for block addition by an authorized IoT device. SHA 256 is used for implementing hashing in blockchain. Three different systems namely System 1, 2, and 3 are considered for the experiment under different settings of design parameters.

Consequently, B5G-Driven edge computing allows a growing volume of data to be collected from and transmitted among pervasive edge devices for big data analytics. The collected big data becomes the driving force of artificial intelligence (AI) by training high-quality machine learning (ML) models, which is followed by severe individual privacy leakage. Federated learning(FL) is then proposed to achieve privacy-preserving machine learning by avoiding the exchange of raw data. Unfortunately, several major issues remain outstanding. Centralized processing costs significant communication resources between cloud and edge while data falsification problems persist. In addition, the private data may be reconstructed by malicious participants by exploiting the context of model parameters in FL. To solve the identified problems, we propose to integrate blockchain-enabled FL with Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) enabled differential privacy (DP) to protect the model parameters of edge devices in B5G networks. Blockchain enables decentralized FL to reduce communication costs between cloud and edge while alleviating the data falsification issues, and it also provides an incentive mechanism to alleviate the data island issue in B5G-Driven edge computing. WGAN is used to generate controllable random noise complying with DP requirements, which is then injected to model parameters. WGAN-enabled DP is able to achieve an optimized trade-off between differential privacy protection and improved data utility of model parameters. Time delay analysis is conducted to show the efficiency of the proposed model. Extensive evaluation results from simulations demonstrate superior performances from aspects of convergence efficiency, accuracy, and data utility.","Blockchain, Federated learning, Differential privacy protection, Wasserstein generative adversarial nets",,

We have used a random forest classifier model (RFCM) on the road accidents dataset to predict the accident severity, i.e., fatal, serious, and slight. It is based on road type, light condition, and vehicle movement to be shared among other AVs. We have considered various scenarios and performed the predictive analysis that needs to be secured by using blockchain technology. Results of the study demonstrate the accuracy of RFCM as 93%, the precision of 98%, 97%, and 87% for fatal, serious, and slight categories of accident severity, respectively. The results show that the proposed scheme with RFCM yields better accuracy of 93% than other existing classification algorithms such as Decision tree, Naive Bayes, and AdaBoost. The blockchain-based proposed system has been compared with the traditional approach based on parameters such as network latency, scalability, computation time, delay comparison for node validation, data storage latency, and data storage cost. Obtained results show that the proposed scheme enables the data sharing reliable, secure, and efficient for AVs and outperforms the blockchain and non-blockchain systems in terms of security and efficiency.","Blockchain, Random forest, Latency, Scalability, Edge intelligence, 5G",,

Traditional IoT architecture is heavily centralized, where data stored in a cloud environment is prone to several kinds of threats.

The proposed architecture fits well with event-driven IoT devices and uses the edge and the cloudlet computing paradigm as well as HIBE to preserve the privacy. Furthermore, the efficiency of the proposed architecture is demonstrated using a real-life case, namely, traffic speed radars. The security of the proposed architecture is analyzed and is verified through theoretical analysis that considers the existence of a malicious adversary.

This research article proposes a lightweight and privacy-preserving certificateless authentication scheme in fog-assisted VANET using blockchain technology and neuro-fuzzy machine learning technique. A new authentication scheme is designed using certificateless signature based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and hash function operation. The scheme utilizes two blockchains to achieve decentralized and transparent transactions and revocation process. In order to prevent denial-of-service attack, in which a roadside unit (RSU) is flooded with a massive amount of fake authentication requests so as to prevent legitimate nodes from being authenticated, a neuro-fuzzy algorithm is implemented to proactively detect and discard any anomalous requests prior to an authentication process. Moreover, the scheme is demonstrated to be semantically secure in the random oracle model (ROM) based on the intractability of the discrete logarithm problem (DLP). A panoptic analysis shows that the scheme possesses outstanding attributes required for a secure vehicular communication system. The experimental simulation is conducted using simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) and the broadly-accepted network simulator NS-3. The results indicate that the proposed scheme has a high efficiency in terms of transmission delay and message delivery rate.

The traditional authentication methods (password-based, certificate-based and biometric-based) are not directly applicable due to the unique architecture and characteristics of the Fog. Moreover, the traditional authentication methods consume significantly more computation power and incur high latency, and this does not meet the key requirements of the Fog.

Firstly, it reconstructs the networking mode between the blockchain nodes in smart cities based on RON so that the blockchain nodes can quickly detect the link state of the Internet in smart cities. The shortest path algorithm and policy routing are then applied to construct the propagation path between the blockchain nodes to optimize the Gossip propagation mechanism and enhance the QoS and QoE. Simulation results show that the RON-based blockchain network propagation mechanism for edge-enabled smart cities is beneficial in terms of average route hop count, transmission success rate, routing overhead, average delay, and reduced fork probability.","Blockchain fork, Resilient overlay network, Propagation delay, Gossip, Optimal propagation mechanism",,

It is indispensable to authenticate devices in the IIoT environment. In this paper, we propose two blockchain-based authentication for IIoT devices with PUF. The first one relies on SRAM PUF, which is highly compatible with physical devices and has low cost. For the second one, we utilize the property of Arbiter PUF that it is difficult to physically clone but easy to be cloned mathematically to build the PUF models for authentication. We protect CRPs used for model training from leakage, and prevent PUF from being modeled twice. We formalize the security properties, and we prove that our proposal is secure. Besides, our proposal achieves scalability, which means that the entities involved in the scheme authenticate the devices instead of storing amounts of CRPs. Finally, we take SVM as an example to model PUF, and the implementation results demonstrate that the PUF model could achieve the accuracy of 99.9%. In addition, we implement smart contracts, and the implementation results confirm the availability of the protocol in the IIoT environment.","IIoT, Blockchain, PUF, Device authentication, Data security",,

Thus, edge-thing systems will replace the classic cloud-thing/cloud-edge-thing systems and become mainstream gradually, where IoT devices can offload their tasks to neighboring edge nodes. A common problem is how to utilize edge computing resources. For the sake of fairness, double auction can be used in the edge-thing system to achieve an effective resource allocation and pricing mechanism. Due to the lack of third-party management agencies and mutual distrust between nodes, in our edge-thing systems, we introduce blockchains to prevent malicious nodes from tampering with transaction records and smart contracts to act as an auctioneer to realize resources auction. Since the auction results stored in this blockchain-based system are transparent, they are threatened with inference attacks. Thus in this paper, we design a differentially private combinatorial double auction mechanism by exploring the exponential mechanism such that maximizing the revenue of edge computing platform, in which each IoT device requests a resource bundle and edge nodes compete with each other to provide resources. It can not only guarantee approximate truthfulness and high revenue, but also ensure privacy security. Through necessary theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, the effectiveness of our proposed mechanisms can be validated.","Internet of Things, Blockchain, Smart contract, Edge-thing system, Combinatorial auction, Truthfulness, Revenue, Differential privacy",,

A shared tenancy model where multiple untrusted applications or tenants utilize the same pub/sub system is generally exploited in edge cloud, which poses crucial challenges including privacy-sensitive data/metadata access threat and critical metadata modification by unauthorized tenants. A centralized monitoring node is invariably adopted in existing security strategies (such as ACL, TLS), which causes the pub/sub streaming model vulnerable to external malicious attacks and single point failure. In this paper, inspired by outstanding features of blockchain including tamper-resistance, decentralization, strong consistency, and traceability, we propose BPS, a general and decentralized Blockchain-enhanced Pub/Sub communication model for multi-tenant edge cloud, to redesign pub/sub system internal security mechanisms. Specifically, by exploiting blockchain technology, BPS can detect the illegal operations and behaviors from both malicious tenants and untrusted publishers or subscribers. BPS directly leverages Merkel Hash Tree (MHT) of blockchain to verify the integrity of critical and confidential metadata. Regarding authorization, BPS introduces smart-contract-enabled fine-grained control over partition topic-classified messages by storing access control list (ACL) into an append-only blockchain ledger. Additionally, an incentive mechanism is employed in BPS to reward honest publishers and subscribers. We implement BPS prototype based on Kafka and EoS blockchain. Our security analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that BPS outperforms the state-of-the-art pub/sub streaming system Kafka in security with minimal performance overhead.","Blockchain, Smart city, Pub/sub system, Edge cloud, Security",,

The agreements between the nodes participating in a blockchain network are defined through smart contracts. However, the compilation, deployment, interaction and monitoring of these smart contracts is a barrier compromising the accessibility of blockchains by non-expert developers. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a low-code approach, called EDALoCo, that facilitates the development of event-driven applications for smart contract management. These applications make blockchain more accessible for software developers who are non-experts in this technology as these can be modeled through graphical flows, which specify the communications between data producers, data processors and data consumers. Specifically, we have enhanced the open-source Node-RED low-code platform with blockchain technology, giving support for the creation of user-friendly and lightweight event-driven applications that can compile and deploy smart contracts in a particular blockchain. Additionally, this platform extension allows users to interact with and monitor the smart contracts already deployed in a blockchain network, hiding the implementation details from non-experts in blockchain. This approach was successfully applied to a case study of COVID-19 vaccines to monitor and obtain the temperatures to which these vaccines are continuously exposed, to process them and then to store them in a blockchain network with the aim of making them immutable and traceable to any user. As a conclusion, our approach enables the integration of blockchain with the low-code paradigm, simplifying the development of lightweight event-driven applications for smart contract management.

Due to rapid population growth, there is an urgent need for devising water saving solutions. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based incentivized edge computing framework for water saving using soft computing methodologies. The framework facilitates decision makers in creating awareness among people about water savings in a easily understandable scientific way. Our incentivized blockchain based model uses edge computing at the house nodes of the network to predict the actual usage of a particular household in the locality based on several factors such as number of people, average income of family, profession of the members and previous water demands. By using Feed Forward Networks and Mixture Density Networks, we predict the water usage in terms of input factors and historical usage respectively, thus incorporating machine computing into the framework. With the two values from these methods, a comparison is made with the actual amount of water used by the householders. This research proposes deployment of the smart contract on the blockchain network for efficient and accurate reward distribution. Incentives and rewards are given in the blockchain network to houses with lesser consumption and penalties are imposed when usage crosses predicted and historic usage. The model ensures that accurate incentives are provided to the people in order to motivate them to avoid wastage of water. Results show that the methods used in our work perform better than other relevant networks on a self-synthesized dataset.

General Computing has issues in latency, security, and automatic decision making. In smart cities adding to general computing comes with processing delays in addition to transmission delay. So smart cities process added to cloud/edge computing, which provides a promising way of enabling applications by offering computation and storage resources with low latency. Edge computing reduces the network bandwidth usage by alleviating the transmission of data from end-users to the remote cloud. The edge computing paradigm is characterized primarily by its geodistributed, low latency. In addition to the edge, fog node covers a wide range of devices such as routers, wireless access points, and data centers. In smart cities that infrastructure provides novel security risks and challenges due to centralized cloud. To enable security must protect all devices from attacks by implementing diverse security mechanisms. Security in edge computing is mainly based on the denial of services and privacy leakage. To avoid attacks, we are providing smart contracts through the reduction of need in trusted intermediates, fraud losses as well as reduction of malicious intentions. It must be devised for edge computing enabled in smart cities to ensure user privacy. In smart cities, decision making is based on data combined with analytics to improve decision making. Enabling the resource-intensive and latency-sensitive smart city applications provides a solution for reliable performance of increasing end-users. The surveillance camera in small cities continuously takes images of the cities and requires further processing of these images to determine the wrong activities in smart cities. Edge computing to enable on-demand telecommunication and computing infrastructure helps to assist rescue activities. The major issue of smart cities includes latency, security, and decision making. The requirements of the latency and security in smart cities can be satisfied by edge computing and fog computing.

To improve the production efficiency in mass individualization of rapid PCB prototyping, this paper proposed a cloud-edge orchestration-based bi-level autonomous process control (CEO-BAPC) framework.

The bi-level autonomous process control architecture avoids the inconsistency between holistic control and local execution under frequent random disturbances and thereby realizes efficient manufacturing of mass individualization.

In this study, we propose a novel, distributed blockchain-based security architecture that today's industrial edge-enabled IoT systems may use to strengthen their defences against cyberattacks. We develop a probabilistic model to estimate the success probability of a malicious attacker on blockchain-based edge network by considering (i) hardware-level attack, (ii) network-level attack (IoT, Edge), (iii) software-level attack, wallet, smart contract, and (iv) blockchain network-level attack.

Our model considers scenarios where private keys are stolen, lost, or forgotten by certain nodes. To determine the probability that a malicious attacker will be successful, we develop a simulation environment (a blockchain-based edge network with 200 total nodes, which generates 47,540 samples). We then estimate the success probability of a malicious attacker based on the blockchain resiliency (fault-tolerance) provided by the consensus algorithm, attack types, attack location, and the network size for various scenarios. Our results demonstrate that blockchain-based edge networks are more vulnerable to malicious attacks based on: (i) cyber-attack types (90.96% for Botnet and Backdoor Trojan attacks higher than for other attacks, such as DDoS, SQL Injection and Sybil); (ii) attack location (90.18% for software-level attacks higher than hardware, network, and blockchain network-level attacks); and (iii) consensus algorithm (68.85% for Byzantine fault tolerance, BFT, higher than the Proof-of-Work, PoW). The IoT network vulnerability factor, or exposure factor, of cyberattacks, depends on the strategic importance of the application to the attacker.

Energy trading among EVs and charging stations (CS) in a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) environment is one of the popular verticals in smart grid. However, processing the energy trading decisions at remote control centers lead to an increase in delay and network overhead. Apart from these issues, the security concerns while trading the energy in such an environment remain persistent. Therefore, to handle the aforementioned issues, this paper presents SURVIVOR: A Blockchain based Edge-as-a-Service Framework for Secure Energy Trading in software defined networking (SDN)-enabled V2G Environment. In the proposed framework, the energy trading decisions are processed closer to the location of EVs through edge nodes. Moreover, for securing the energy trading transactions, blockchain is used wherein the approver nodes are selected amongst all the present nodes on the basis of a utility function and are made responsible for validating the transactions. Once such nodes are selected, a consensus-based blockchain mechanism for secure energy trading in SDN-enabled V2G environment is presented. In this mechanism, edge nodes are responsible for generating proof-of-work puzzles. The proof-of-work is a unique hash value which is computed for each EV and the transactions for which the approver nodes compute the same proof-of-work for each EV are added in the blockchain. The complete scheme is backed by the SDN architecture to reduce the overall latency and increase the throughput of the smart transportation network. The results obtained prove that the proposed scheme is effective for trading the energy between EVs and CS while securing the underlying trading transactions using blockchain. Moreover, the communication and computation cost of the proposed scheme comes out to be small which proves that it can be used in real-world applications. The latency in the complete transportation sector is also greatly reduced by using the SDN-architecture.","Blockchain, Edge-as-a-service, Energy trading, Smart city, Software defined networking",,

A novel algorithm is proposed, which adds edge-based perturbation signals to the process of consensus computation. Our algorithm can be divided into two phases: a coordinated scrambling phase, which is for privacy preservation, and a convergence phase. In the scrambling phase, each agent is required to generate some perturbation signals and add them to the edges leading out of it. In the convergence phase, the agents update their states following a normal updating rule. It is shown that an internal honest-but-curious agent can obtain the privacy of a target agent if and only if no other agents can communicate with the target agent. As for external eavesdroppers, it is proved that this kind of attackers can never obtain any agent's privacy.","Multi-agent systems, Average consensus, Privacy preservation, Edge-based perturbation signals",,

However, since the deployment of IoT based devices is in an open field, the IoV environments can be a vital issue in the absence of security protections. In this paper, we propose an efficient authentication scheme over blockchain, named EASBF, for secure fog computing-enabled internet of vehicles. Specifically, the proposed EASBF scheme consists of five phases: initialization, registration, mutual authentication, and exchanging keys, consensus, and certificate update. Based on the elliptic curve cryptography, one-way hash function, and blockchain technology, the EASBF scheme can achieve confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, privacy, anonymity, non-repudiation, and perfect forward secrecy. The EASBF scheme is robust against cyber attacks, including, DDoS attack, replay attack, man-in-the-middle attacks, identity theft attack, traffic analysis attack, masquerading attack, and session key disclosure attack. Both the AVISPA tool and the random oracle model are used in security analysis.

Latency-sensitive resource orchestration in CPS applications is extraordinarily essential for maintaining the Quality of Experience (QoE) for users. Although edge-cloud computing performs effectively in achieving latency-aware resource allocation in CPIoTS, existing methods fail to jointly consider the security and reliability requirements, thereby increasing the process latency of tasks and degrading the QoE of users. This paper aims to minimize the system latency of edge-cloud computing coupled with CPS while simultaneously considering the security and reliability requirements. We first consider a time-varying channel model as a Finite-State Markov Channel (FSMC) and propose a distributed blockchain-assisted CPIoTS to realize secure consensus and reliable resource orchestration by offloading computation tasks in edge-cloud computing. Moreover, we propose an efficient resource allocation algorithm, PPO-SRRA, that optimizes computing offloading and multi-dimension resource (e.g., communication, computation, and consensus resource) allocation by using a policy-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method. The experimental results show that the proposed resource allocation scheme can reduce the system latency and ensure consensus security.","Cyber-physical internet of things system, Blockchain, Reinforcement learning (RL), Edge-cloud computing",,

Rigorous convergence analysis is carried out. Based on the special properties of positive systems, sufficient conditions of positive edge consensus with input saturation are given without using global topology information, that is, the topology information in the given results only relates to the edge and vertex number of the nodal network. Furthermore, the nonnegative edge consensus problem with uncertain parameters is also studied based on the properties of Metzler matrix.

The highlight of the current work is to provide practically computable rates of convergence to consensus that hold for a large class of time-varying edge weights. A novel analysis technique based on classical notions of persistence of excitation and uniform complete observability is proposed. The new analysis technique for consensus laws under time-varying graphs provides explicit bounds on rate of convergence to consensus for single integrator dynamics. In the case of double integrators a minor modification to the standard relative state feedback law is shown to guarantee exponential convergence to consensus under similar assumptions as the single integrator case. The consensus problem is re-formulated in the edge agreement framework to which persistence of excitation based results apply. A novel application of results from Ramsey theory allows for proof of consensus and convergence rate estimation under switching graph topology.

In this paper, we address the theoretical foundation and the necessary conditions for the convergence of opinion formation's nonlinear dynamics to the true states. For this purpose, we extend a probabilistic fuzzy model of opinion formation to include the effect of perceiving random and vague media content on the uncertainty of individuals' opinions. In this model, each individual faces an uncertain media that is statistically modeled. Hence the individual perceives a probabilistic fuzzy set of possible environmental states and shapes its probabilistic fuzzy opinion (belief) based on its perceptions and negotiations. Theoretical results reveal that the media contents should be statistically supportive of the true state and that the coefficients in the belief update algorithms should be selected within the extracted bounds for the perception aggregation process and the proposed optimistic and pessimistic assuring operators. Application to two networks with different sizes of 94 and 918 nodes with 1134 and 206869 edges, respectively, confirms these theoretical conclusions. These simulation results show that higher diversity is observed in the opinions of the highly connected individuals. Furthermore, convergence is delayed for the larger network, i.e. there remain few individuals with differing opinions until the late stages of convergence. It is also shown that model convergence to the true state may deteriorate if parameter settings do not adhere to the theoretically obtained bounds.","Network dynamics, Opinion formation, Probabilistic fuzzy logic, Social networks analysis",,

Firstly, an ADET consensus control protocol under one-to-all ETC is proposed and a sufficient condition for consensus is derived. Compared with most existing triggering rules, the on-line triggering parameter associated with each node makes the controller be designed in a fully distributed way.

The one-to-one ETC provides a flexible self-regulated transmission mode. An effective fully distributed and observer-based consensus protocol is developed appropriately with available local measurement outputs, under which the agents are not required to have a priori knowledge of any global information.

The dynamic of information diffusion is divided into two processes, referred to as post transmission and post distribution, representing the users' behavior and the social network algorithm, respectively. Individuals also interact with the post content by slightly adjusting their own opinion and sometimes redefining friendships. Our results show that the dynamic converge to various scenarios, which go from consensus formation to polarization. Importantly, friendship rewiring helps promote echo chamber formation, which can also arise for particular networks with well-defined community structures.

It is then shown that the mean square consensusability is solely determined by the edge state dynamics on a directed spanning tree. As a result, sufficient conditions are provided for mean square consensus over fading networks with directed graphs in terms of fading parameters, the network topology and the agent dynamics. Moreover, the role of network topology on the mean square consensusability is discussed.

We also develop detailed analysis based on our algorithm, including its convergence property and the topology condition of privacy leakages for each agent. It can be observed that final consensus point is independent of their initial values that can be arbitrary random values. Besides, when an eavesdropper exists and can intercept the data transmitted on the edges, we introduce an index to measure the privacy leakage degree of agents, and then analyze the degree of privacy leakage for each agent.

Each agent has sequentially arriving samples of its belief in an online manner. The neighbor relationships among the n agents are described by a graph which is possibly time-varying, whose vertices correspond to agents and whose edges depict neighbor relationships. Two distributed online algorithms are introduced for undirected and directed graphs, which are both shown to converge to the average belief almost surely. Moreover, the sequences generated by both algorithms are shown to reach consensus with an O(1∕t) rate with high probability, where t is the number of iterations For undirected graphs, the corresponding algorithm is modified for the case with quantized communication and limited precision of the division operation. It is shown that the modified algorithm causes all n agents to either reach a quantized consensus or enter a small neighborhood around the average of their beliefs.

As an immediate benefit, it improves network reliability and latency by enabling data access and processing rapidly and efficiently near IoT devices. However, it comes with several issues stemming from the complexity, the security, the energy consumption, and the instability due to the decentralization of service localization. Furthermore, the multi-resource allocation and task scheduling make this task the furthest from being straightforward. Blockchain has been envisioned to enforce trustworthiness in diverse IoT environments. However, high latency and high energy costs are incurred to process IoT transactions. This paper introduces a novel Blockchain-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to enable energy-aware task scheduling and offloading in an Software Defined Networking (SDN)-enabled IoT network. The Asynchronous Actor--Critic Agent (A3C) DRL-based policy achieves efficient task scheduling and offloading.

By doing so, we improve reliability and low latency and achieve energy efficiency for SDN-enabled IoT networks. The A3C policy combined with the Blockchain is proved theoretically.

Communication among agents is modeled as a randomly directed and periodically switching graph with different edge weights. The existence of any edge is probabilistic and independent of the existence of any other edge. We further allow each edge to be weighted differently. By applying the orthogonal decomposition method the system state vector can be decomposed as two transversal components, one of which evolves along the consensus manifold, and the other evolves transversally with the consensus manifold. Several sufficient conditions for asymptotically almost sure consensus are derived for the cases of time-delay-free coupling and time-delay coupling, respectively. For the first case, we find that if there exists one directed spanning tree in the network corresponding to the fixed time-average topology with sufficiently fast switching rate of the dynamic network, then a second-order dynamic consensus can be guaranteed by the choice of suitable parameters. For the second case, we propose three criteria based on algebraic inequality for reaching a second-order dynamic consensus. The obtained results are quite powerful and can be further used to solve various switching cases for complex dynamical networks. Finally, we provide numerical simulations illustrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.","Second-order consensus, Random switching, Multi-agent systems, Nonlinear dynamics, Time-delay(-free) coupling, Directed spanning tree",,

The controller depends only on relative information of the agents. Since finding the control gain for such controller is hard, we focus on finding an optimal controller among a classical family of controllers which is based on Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) and guarantees asymptotic consensus. Through analysis, we find that the energy cost is bounded by an interval and hence we minimize the upper bound. In order to do that, there are two classes of variables that need to be optimized: the control gain and the edge weights of the graph and are hence designed from two perspectives. A suboptimal control gain is obtained by choosing Q=0 in the ARE. Negative edge weights are allowed, and the problem is formulated as a Semi-definite Programming (SDP) problem. Having negative edge weights means that ``competitions'' between the agents are allowed. The motivation behind this setting is to have a better system performance. We provide a different proof compared to Thunberg and Hu (2016) from the angle of optimization and show that the lowest control energy cost is reached when the graph is complete and with equal edge weights. Furthermore, two sufficient conditions for the existence of negative optimal edge weights realization are given. In addition, we provide a distributed way of solving the SDP problem when the graph topology is regular.","Consensus control, Multi-agent systems, Optimal control, Semi-definite programming, Distributed optimization",,

Methods Three Chinese databases (CNKI, VIP, and Wan Fang Data) were searched for published articles on TCM treatment of diabetic nephropathy (DN) from their inception until September 31, 2014. Zheng classification and herb data were extracted from included articles and used to construct a Zheng classification and treatment of diabetic nephropathy (DNZCT) network with nodes denoting Zhengs and herbs and edges denoting corresponding treating relationships among them. Community detection was applied to the DNZCT and detected community structures were analyzed. Results A network of 201 nodes and 743 edges were constructed and six communities were detected. Nodes clustered in the same community captured the same semantic topic; different communities had unique characteristics, and indicated different treatment principles. Large communities usually represented similar points of view or consensuses on common Zheng diagnoses and herb prescriptions; small communities might help to indicate unusual Zhengs and herbs. Conclusion The results suggest that the community detection-based approach is useful and feasible for uncovering consensuses and treatment principles of DN treatment in TCM, and could be used to address other similar problems in TCM.","Social computing, Community detection, Zheng classification and treatment, Diabetic nephropathy, Traditional Chinese medicine",,

Automatic extraction of field boundaries from satellite imagery would reduce the reliance on manual input of these records, which is time consuming, and would underpin the provision of remote products and services. The lack of current field boundary data sets seems to indicate low uptake of existing methods, presumably because of expensive image preprocessing requirements and local, often arbitrary, tuning. In this paper, we propose a data-driven, robust and general method to facilitate field boundary extraction from satellite images. We formulated this task as a multi-task semantic segmentation problem. We used ResUNet-a, a deep convolutional neural network with a fully connected UNet backbone that features dilated convolutions and conditioned inference to identify: 1) the extent of fields; 2) the field boundaries; and 3) the distance to the closest boundary. By asking the algorithm to reconstruct three correlated outputs, the model's performance and its ability to generalise greatly improve. Segmentation of individual fields was then achieved by post-processing the three model outputs, e.g., via thresholding or watershed segmentation. Using a single monthly composite image from Sentinel-2 as input, our model was highly accurate in mapping field extent, field boundaries and, consequently, individual fields. Replacing the monthly composite with a single-date image close to the compositing period marginally decreased accuracy. We then showed in a series of experiments that, without recalibration, the same model generalised well across resolutions (10 m to 30 m), sensors (Sentinel-2 to Landsat-8), space and time. Building consensus by averaging model predictions from at least four images acquired across the season is paramount to reducing the temporal variations of accuracy. Our convolutional neural network is capable of learning complex hierarchical contextual features from the image to accurately detect field boundaries and discard irrelevant boundaries, thereby outperforming conventional edge filters. By minimising over-fitting and image preprocessing requirements, and by replacing local arbitrary decisions by data-driven ones, our approach is expected to facilitate the extraction of individual crop fields at scale.","Agriculture, Field boundaries, Sentinel-2, Semantic segmentation, Instance segmentation, Multitasking, Computer vision, Generalisation",,

In this paper we start with this theoretical framework and extend it from a practical point of view. The two main methodological contributions we make are: (1) an adaptation of the well-known BN learning algorithm GES (Greedy Equivalence Search) to the case of having a set of BNs as input instead of data (we prove the correctness of the adapted algorithm, i.e., under certain standard assumptions the optimal solution for the BN fusion process is obtained); and (2) a heuristic method for identifying a suitable order of the variables, which allows us to obtain consensus BNs having (far) fewer edges than those obtained by using random orderings. Finally, we design several computational experiments to test our proposals. From the results, we can conclude that the consensus network can be efficiently obtained by using the proposed heuristic to compute the total order of the variables, with this DAG being very close to the optimal one.","Bayesian networks, Aggregation, Fusion, Consensus, Heuristic orders",,

The novel asynchronous edge-event triggered mechanisms are proposed to avoid continuous information transmission between neighbors, under which each subsystem does not exhibit the Zeno behavior. Compared with the existing works, the highlight of this paper is based on edge communication and the construction of triggering mechanism depends on the information of the edge. Moreover, compared with the event-triggered mechanism, the edge-event triggered mechanism is a more distributed information exchange mode and each agent transmits information to its out-neighbors asynchronously, thus effectively reducing the use of system resources. Finally, a practice simulation example is introduced to demonstrate the main results of this paper.

According to Heider's hypothesis of balance certain combinations of positive and negative edges in a network confer stability-balance-to the networks, while others -- imbalanced networks -- are unstable and tend towards balance. Here, we review the concept of structural balance starting from ``first principles'' based on the original formulation of Heider. Based on Harary's ``tendency towards completeness'' hypothesis we formulate that a network is balanced if it can give rise to a balanced complete signed graph. We then propose an algorithm for edge completion of networks and prove several results concerning the balance of cycles, and graphs. We then consider balance as a dynamic process in which the entities of the system try to make agreements by pairs to reach consensus or ``agreed upon dissensus''. At this point we arrive at a few general conditions that any index quantifying the degree of balance -- or degree of imbalance -- has to have. We then analyze a degree of balance index proposed by Estrada and Benzi (2014) and show that it fulfills all these requirements. In contrast, we show how some other approaches to quantify the degree of balance are incomplete and we provide examples of the difficulties found with their use. Using all these developed conceptions about the level of balance in signed social networks we proceed to the study of the international relation among countries in the world for the period 1938--2008. We conclude that the system of international relations is highly imbalanced for the whole period with no trend to increasing balance with the passage of time. Finally, we consider the use of degree of balance indices relative to null models and clarify that they do not account for the degree of balance of a signed network but for the ``effort'' needed to create such degree of balance among a large set of randomly shuffled networks.",,,

However, the inherent characteristics of the organic agricultural supply chain (OASC)--such as centralization, monopoly, and asymmetry--have repeatedly plunged OASC into the predicament of information non-transparency. Ultimately, it results in a severe trust crisis of consumers. Fortunately, the emerging blockchain and edge computing technology probably raise an opportunity to improve this issue. Despite the overwhelming advantage (such as tamper-resistant, trust-free, transparent, decentralized, and immutable), this technology has to overcome the imperfection of cost and efficiency before it can be employed by OASC, particularly for geographically dispersed small and medium-sized farms in remote areas. In this paper, we first leverage the immutability of blockchain and the paradigm of edge computing to construct an OASC's trust framework, which has a much better trade-off between cost and efficiency. Further, according to the scenarios of OASC, we divide all the stakeholders into four roles, proposing a novel consensus mechanism to manage the information flow. The evaluation results demonstrate that our proposal can significantly achieve the performance improvement as well as the cost decline compared to the traditional approach. This framework will also make affordable traceability solutions for those in developing countries at a low cost in the future.","Blockchain, Organic agricultural supply chain (OASC), Edge computing, Traceability, Trust",,

Since edge servers and devices (hereafter referred to as NODEs) are highly scattered, blockchain is becoming one of the most promising solutions to enhance security issues for IoT. In the blockchain, a consensus mechanism determines how to achieve an agreement among nodes, hence it is an essential element for the operation and efficiency of the blockchain. However, due to the exponentially increasing of nodes in IoT, the consensus efficiency of the traditional consensus mechanism will be greatly reduced, and due to the lack of detection process for malicious nodes, its security will also reduce. To solve the above problems, in this paper, a Reputation and Voting based Consensus mechanism (RVC) is proposed. To reduce the time consumption of the consensus process, RVC adopts a reputation evaluation algorithm without complex hash calculations to select block proposers, which both consider the behaviors in edge computing and blockchain consensus. To prevent malicious nodes from participating in consensus, a filtering algorithm is designed for RVC, which can detect and filter nodes with malicious behaviors. Simulation results show that, RVC outperforms some traditional work. On time consumption, compared with AirBC and hybrid blockchain, RVC improved by 73.6% and 93.7% respectively. And on consensus security, RVC improved by 14% compared with LVBS. When the network scale and the proportion of malicious nodes change exponentially, RVC shows good scalability in terms of time consumption, successful consensus rate and transaction throughput.","Edge computing (EC), Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, Consensus, Voting, Reputation",,

Additionally, the dynamics of all the agents are subjected to unknown disturbances, which are represented by linearly parameterized models. An adaptive estimation scheme is designed for each agent by virtue of the relative position measurements and the relative velocity measurements from its neighbors. Then a consensus tracking law is proposed for a new distributed system, which uses the relative measurements as the new state variables. The convergence of the consensus tracking error and the parameter estimation are analyzed even when the coopetition network is time-varying and no more global information about the bounds of the unknown disturbances is available to all the agents. Finally, some simulation results are provided to demonstrate the formation of the bipartite consensus on the coopetition network.","Bipartite consensus tracking, Coopetition networks, Structural balance, Unknown disturbances",,

Trusting relationships and similar opinions among decision makers have been proven to exert important but different impacts on large-scale group consensus. We propose a large-scale group consensus-reaching method based on integrated relationships between trust and the similarity of opinions (``opinion similarity''). First, we propose a directed tuple of trust and opinion similarity to blend the information about trust and opinion similarity among decision makers, and construct an integrated relationship network among decision makers based on trust and opinion similarity. Second, leadership-based network partitioning theory is used to divide the integrated relationship network, and the decision maker with the highest degree of recommendation is selected as the representative of each subnetwork. Considering the strength of the integrated relationships and the similarity of opinions of the subnetworks, we add directed edges between the representative of each subnetwork and the rest of the subnetworks, to ensure that leaders exist between all subnetworks, which is effective for reaching group consensus. In an integrated relationship network, decision makers' opinions are evolved using opinion dynamics theory to obtain group consensus results. Finally, a numerical experiment is used to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method, and comparative analysis demonstrates its advantages. The proposed large-scale group consensus-reaching method based on integrated trust--opinion similarity relationships can significantly reduce the initial changes in the opinions of decision makers and is applicable to solving a variety of practical problems related to large-scale group decision-making.","Large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM), Integrated relationship, Consensus-reaching process (CRP), Trust, Opinion similarity, Network partition",,

Many efforts have been devoted to understanding how opinion dynamics is affected by network topology. However, social interactions are best characterized as temporal networks in which ordering of interactions cannot be ignored. Temporal activity patterns including heterogeneous contact strength and interevent times, turnover edge/node dynamics, and daily patterns could have significant effects that would not be captured by static aggregate network representations. In this paper, we study the effects of such temporal patterns on the speed of consensus formation in various models of continuous opinion dynamics using four empirical data sets, including three human face-to-face networks from different real-world settings and a social insect interaction network. We find that static, aggregated networks consistently overestimate the speed of simulated consensus formation while weight heterogeneity associated with frequency of interactions has an inhibitory effect on consensus formation relative to the behavior on unweighted networks. Moreover, the speed of consensus formation is found to be highly sensitive to nodal lifetimes, suggesting that randomization protocols that dramatically alter the distribution of lifetimes cannot be relied upon as reference models. On the other hand, temporal patterns including burstiness of interevent times and the lifetime of edges are found to have insignificant effects on consensus formation. The sensitivity to nodal lifetimes is further demonstrated via synthetic networks generated by an activity-driven model with tunable nodal lifetimes.","Opinion dynamics, Deffuant model, Consensus formation, Temporal networks, Coordination",,

In the scenario of the proposed designs, each local controller is realized by a parallel connection of a public element and a private element. The public elements are uniform and open access. However, the private elements are allowed to be significant nonuniform and are only known by the pairs of agents who share them.

The proposed fully-distributed consensus approach deals with the local scenario as compared to the traditional consensus control for the globally Lipschitz models. The dynamics of nonlinear systems are considered to satisfy the Lipschitz condition locally and an adaptive fully-distributed relative-state consensus protocol has been established for ensuring a coherent behavior of agents. A local leader-following adaptive consensus controller design condition, for obtaining the adaptive consensus protocol gain, has been formulated using the proposed local treatment, adaptation law for coupling weights, ellipsoidal regional investigation, asymptotic stability consideration, and Lyapunov redesign. The developed results are enriched for attaining a robust adaptive consensus of the locally Lipschitz multi-agents against disturbances by using the local L2 stability approach. This developed technique can be effective for minimizing the effect of external disturbances on the consensus error. From technical point of view, the proposed method can be used for the locally Lipschitz models, like systems having polynomial approximations in their models. Further, the proposed approach adapts (similar to routing in communication) in accordance with the requirement of control gains for a communication topology. Furthermore, our method can be applied to deal with the unwanted disturbance (like change in air flow speed or direction and external perturbations) for attaining a robust design. In contrast to existing studies, the proposed results consider adaptive and H∞ consensus schemes for the higher-order locally Lipschitz multi-agents. The developed results are verified for a network of six vendor pol multi-agent systems and modified Chua's circuits.","Adaptive consensus, Leader-following consensus, consensus, Locally Lipschitz agents, Region of stability",,

Fifth-generation (5G) cellular networks (5G-CNs) with network slicing (NS) have emerged as a necessity for future mobile communication. The available network is partitioned logically into multiple virtual networks to provide an enormous range of users' specific services. Efficient resource allocation methods are critical to delivering the customers with their required Quality of Service (QoS) priorities. In this work, we have investigated a QoS based resource allocation (RA) scheme considering two types of 5G slices with different service requirements; (1) enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) slice that requires a very high data rate and (2) massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC) slice that requires extremely low latency. We investigated the device-to-device (D2D) enabled 5G-CN model with NS to assign resources to users based on their QoS needs while considering the cellular and D2D user's data rate requirements. We have proposed a Distributed Algorithm (DA) with edge computation to solve the optimization problem, which is novel as edge routers will solve the problem locally using the augmented Lagrange method. They then send this information to the central server to find the global optimum solution utilizing a consensus algorithm. Simulation analysis proves that this scheme is efficient as it assigns resources based on their QoS requirements. This scheme is excellent in reducing the central load and computational time.","Device-to-device, eMBB, mMTC, Network slicing, QoS requirements, 5G cellular networks, Distributed optimization",,

If the undirected graph whose edge weights are positive is connected, then the states of all agents converge to the same state more quickly when compared to most other protocols.

Among these convergent paradigms, Federated Learning (FL) allows the vehicles to train a deep ML model collaboratively, by exchanging model parameters (i.e., neural network weights and biases), rather than raw sensor data, via V2X links. Early FL approaches resorted to a server-client architecture, where a Parameter Server (PS) acts as edge device to orchestrate the learning process. Novel FL tools, on the other hand, target fog architectures where the model parameters are mutually shared by vehicles and synchronized in a distributed manner via consensus algorithms. These tools do not rely on the PS, but take advantage of low-latency V2X links. In line with this recent research direction, in this paper we investigate distributed FL methods for augmenting the capability of road user/object classification based on Lidar data. More specifically, we propose a new modular, decentralized approach to FL, referred to as consensus-driven FL (C-FL), suitable for PointNet compliant deep ML architectures and Lidar point cloud processing for road actor classification. The C-FL process is evaluated by simulating a realistic V2X network, based on the Collective Perception Service (CPS), for mutual sharing of the PointNet model parameters. The performance validation considers the impact of the degree of connectivity of the vehicular network, the benefits of continual learning over heterogeneous training data, convergence time and loss/accuracy tradeoffs. Experimental results indicate that C-FL complies with the extended sensors use cases for high levels of driving automation, it provides a low-latency training service, compared with existing distributed ML approaches, and it outperforms ego learning with minimal bandwidth usage.","Cooperative sensing, Connected automated driving, Distributed computing, Federated learning, 6G V2X, Consensus",,

Decentralized optimization plays a vital role in machine learning and has recently garnered much attention due to its inherent advantage in handling edge computations. Many decentralized optimization algorithms, both projection and projection-free algorithms with theoretical guarantees, have been proposed in the literature, focusing mainly on offline settings. However, for most real-world machine learning problems, the data is often revealed online, for example, in the case of recommender systems, image/video processing, and stock portfolio management. Therefore, in this work, we study decentralized optimization within the framework of online settings with constraints imposed on the optimization solutions (e.g., sparsity or low rank of matrices). More specifically, we consider the problem of optimizing an aggregate of convex loss functions that arrive over time such that their components are distributed over a connected network. We present a consensus-based online decentralized Frank-Wolfe algorithm that uses stochastic gradient estimates, which achieves an asymptotically tight regret guarantee of O(T) where T is a given time horizon. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance of this algorithm for optimizing the online multiclass logistic regression model on real-world standard image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10) by comparing with centralized online algorithms. We achieve better regret bounds than the previously best-known decentralized constrained online algorithms.","Online learning, Distributed learning, Edge computing, Machine learning",,

Then the edge system is confined to a hypercube for the satisfaction of relative constraints. Finally, an output event-triggered control protocol that can exponentially stabilize the edge dynamics with constraints is proposed. Sufficient conditions on system stability are provided, the Singular triggering and the Zeno-behaviour are also excluded.

It expands the capacity of cloud by facilitating data from the end devices to be stored and processed at the edge of the network closer to the data instead of delivering it to the cloud. Data integrity is a big concern in edge computing. As a promising solution to data integrity, blockchain is viable to protect the data in edge computing systems. However, most existing consensus algorithms cannot meet the requirements of edge computing in a dynamic network, where the nodes may join or leave the blockchain network dynamically. In this paper, we introduce a two-layer blockchain-based framework to provide data integrity in edge computing, and propose a novel Dynamic Random Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DR-BFT) consensus algorithm. DR-BFT consists of three sub-algorithms, String Consensus, Data Correctness Validation, and Binary Consensus. String consensus tries to reach consensus on the data of end devices or edge servers, and the sub-algorithm is based on an agreement and borrows some ideas from the Phase King Protocol. If the string consensus fails ``early termination'', each node will agree on a value from a random primary node and go through data correctness validation sub-algorithm. The system then reaches consensus on the data with binary consensus sub-algorithm which is a variant of Ben-Or and Michael's Random Consensus. We also propose an improved quorum method to cope with contention and dynamic node leaving/joining. We analyze DR-BFT with regard to consensus correctness, security, and system overhead. DR-BFT satisfies agreement, validity and termination. We conduct experiments through simulations. Experimental results show that the proposed consensus DR-BFT can effectively improve the performance in dynamic edge computing, including communication overhead and consensus latency.","Blockchain, Consensus, Edge computing, Dynamic network, Data integrity",,

All agents in the MASs do not transmit information until the corresponding triggering mechanisms are satisfied, thus avoiding continuous communication and saving system resources. Then, two kinds of fully distributed edge-event-triggered adaptive protocols are designed to solve the leader-follower problem. The first state feedback control protocol is applicable to scenarios where all states of MASs are available. The second output feedback control protocol does not depend on the availability of the states of MASs. Moreover, under the designed triggering mechanisms and fully distributed edge-event-triggered adaptive consensus strategies, the MASs do not exhibit the Zeno behavior. Finally, two practical simulations are introduced to verify all the theoretical results obtained in this paper.

Novel design conditions, including the necessary and sufficient conditions for the main design approach, by application of decoupling technique for consensus protocol formulation of OSL systems, are presented to evaluate the consensus protocol gains. A distinctive feature of the present work is the development of adaptive output feedback consensus protocol to avoid the state availability requirement in the existing works, by application of an edge-based consensus protocol, Lyapunov theory, graph topology, and nonlinearity bounds. The proposed approach is less conservative and more efficient than existing methods as it can be applied to a broader class of nonlinear systems with large Lipschitz constant. The validity of the proposed technique is verified through numerical simulations of six mobile agents and a practical application of unmanned air vehicles.",,,

In this original setup we firstly introduce notions of unilateral optimistic and/or pessimistic interaction, of associated bicolored edge in the interaction graph and a suitable graph-theoretical connectedness property. Secondly, we formulate a new assumption of integral connectivity and show that it is sufficient to guarantee exponential convergence towards the agreement subspace. Finally, we show that the proposed conditions are also necessary for consensuability and discuss how the new notions of bicolored graph and related connectivity concepts encompass the usual criteria in the standard case of bilateral interactions. Theoretical advances are emphasized through illustrative examples given both to support the discussion and to highlight how the proposed framework extends all existing conditions for consensus of monotone networks.","Monotone systems, Consensus, Synchronization, Multi agent systems",,

To develop fully distributed seeking strategies, two adaptive control laws, including a node-based control law and an edge-based control law, are proposed. In the node-based adaptive strategy, each player adjusts their own weight on their procurable consensus error dynamically. Moreover, in the edge-based algorithm, the fully distributed strategy is designed by adding an adaptively adjusted scaling parameter to the weights of the edges of the communication graph. With the adaptive control laws, the proposed methods are free of any centralized control gains, i.e., the players can update their actions without knowing any centralized information. By utilizing LaSalle's invariance principle, it is shown that the Nash equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under both strategies. In addition, we further show that the edge-based method can be easily adapted to accommodate time-varying communication conditions, in which the communication network is switching among a set of undirected and connected graphs. In the last, numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","Fully distributed Nash equilibrium seeking, Edge-based adaptive control law, Node-based adaptive control law, Networked games",,

The goal of studying the control vs diseases cohorts is to understand that what biological pathways are perturbed in the manifestation of the disease. Although many genetic mutations are associated with the disease, they have varying rate of risk among different patients. This is due the different genomic landscape and environmental conditions that varies from individual to individual. This raises a question that how different set of mutations are linked to the manifestation of the same disease? This can be answered by identifying the consensus gene/biological pathways that are perturbed under disease condition even if the disease has manifested through different set of mutations. To understand this we propose a network-based strategy for gene prioritisation that combines the knowledge of disease associated mutations and the expression pattern of genes in different samples from patients and healthy-controls. The network comprises of three layers, first being the genes with PD associated mutations. The third or target layer comprises of the core pathways associated with PD pathology and the middle layer is composed interacting partners between these two layers. A scoring mechanism for edges was developed using gene expression profiles across different samples and the busiest routes/paths were discovered between the first and the third layer. The results highlight a subset of genes from the middle layer of the network and could classify between the control vs patients sample using machine learning algorithm and are significantly associated with PD pathways.","Parkinson's Disease, Protein-Protein interaction Network, Random forest, Non-synonymous mutations, three-layered network, model selection",,

This paper focuses on the dairy industry, on its need to adapt to the current market by becoming more resource efficient, environment-friendly, transparent and secure. The Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing (EC) and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) are all crucial to the achievement of those improvements because they allow to digitize all parts of the value chain, providing detailed information to the consumer on the final product and ensuring its safety and quality. In Smart Farming environments, IoT and DLT enable resource monitoring and traceability in the value chain, allowing producers to optimize processes, provide the origin of the produce and guarantee its quality to consumers. In comparison to a centralized cloud, EC manages the Big Data generated by IoT devices by processing them at the network edge, allowing for the implementation of services with shorter response times, and a higher Quality of Service (QoS) and security. This work presents a platform oriented to the application of IoT, Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain techniques in Smart Farming environments, by means of the novel Global Edge Computing Architecture, and designed to monitor the state of dairy cattle and feed grain in real time, as well as ensure the traceability and sustainability of the different processes involved in production. The platform is deployed and tested in a real scenario on a dairy farm, demonstrating that the implementation of EC contributes to a reduction in data traffic and an improvement in the reliability in communications between the IoT-Edge layers and the Cloud.","Internet of things, Edge computing, Distributed ledger technologies, Smart farming, Precision agriculture, Livestock monitoring",,

(2019). This paper is an extensively revised and extended version where more than 50% is new material. we describe LUNES-Blockchain, an agent-based simulator of blockchains that relies on Parallel and Distributed Simulation (PADS) techniques to obtain high scalability. The software is organized as a multi-level simulator that permits to simulate a virtual environment, made of many nodes running the protocol of a specific Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), such as the Bitcoin or the Ethereum blockchains. This virtual environment is executed on top of a lower-level Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network overlay, which can be structured based on different topologies and with a given number of nodes and edges. Functionalities at different levels of abstraction are managed separately, by different software modules and with different time granularity. This allows for accurate simulations, where (and when) it is needed, and enhances the simulation performance. Using LUNES-Blockchain, it is possible to simulate different types of attacks on the DLT. In this paper, we specifically focus on the P2P layer, considering the selfish mining, the 51% attack and the Sybil attack. For which concerns selfish mining and the 51% attack, our aim is to understand how much the hash-rate (i.e. a general measure of the processing power in the blockchain network) of the attacker can influence the outcome of the misbehavior. On the other hand, in the filtering denial of service (i.e. Sybil Attack), we investigate which dissemination protocol in the underlying P2P network makes the system more resilient to a varying number of nodes that drop the messages. The results confirm the viability of the simulation-based techniques for the investigation of security aspects of DLTs.","Simulation, Parallel and Distributed Simulation, Virtual environments, Cyber-security, Blockchain, Distributed ledger technologies",,

The blockchain is a tamper-evident, unforgeable distributed ledger that protects security and privacy through the famous algorithm zk-SNARK, which is also widely used in virtual digital currencies such as Zcash. In addition, by using zk-SNARK technology in the Loopring DEX 3.0 in Ethereum, not only decentralization but also transaction performance can be guaranteed. However, there are three main problems of zk-SNARK, one is the need to guarantee calculation accuracy, two is the long time to generate evidence, especially when using Lagrangian interpolation to QAP the transaction data requires more computation; the last is the poor scalability, especially when nodes need to recalculate all data when adding new transactions. In this paper, we propose a modified zk-SNARK based on Newtonian interpolation, improve the QAP part of zk-SNARK by Newtonian interpolation, and verify the correctness of the scheme through instantiation. Finally, we analyze the computational efficiency of the two interpolation methods, and the results show that Newton interpolation solves the above two problems in the original zk-SNARK, and significantly reduces the time complexity of the algorithm, which can further promote the application of blockchain in data management of AIoT.","Blockchain, AIoT, ZK-SNARK, Zero knowledge proof, Newton interpolation",,

Due to the limited budget for security protection, the IIoT devices are vulnerable and easily compromised to launch Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, resulting in disastrous results. Unfortunately, considering the particularity of the IIoT environment, most of the defense solutions in traditional networks cannot be directly applied to IIoT with acceptable security performance. Therefore, in this work, we propose a multi-point collaborative defense mechanism against DDoS attacks for IIoT. Specifically, for the single point DDoS defense, we design an edge-centric mechanism termed EdgeDefense for the detection, identification, classification, and mitigation of DDoS attacks and the generation of defense information. For the practical multi-point scenario, we propose a collaborative defense model against DDoS attacks to securely share the defense information across the network through the blockchain. Besides, a fast defense information sharing mechanism is designed to reduce the delay of defense information sharing and provide a responsive cybersecurity guarantee. The simulation results indicate that the identification and classification performance of the two machine learning models designed for EdgeDefense are better than those of the state-of-the-art baseline models, and therefore EdgeDefense can defend against DDoS attacks effectively. The results also verify that the proposed fast sharing mechanism can reduce the propagation delay of the defense information blocks effectively, thereby improving the responsiveness of the multi-point collaborative DDoS defense.","Industrial internet of things (IIoT), DDoS, Deep learning, Blockchain, Edge computing",,

To cope with these large sets of electronic device's current requirements, better energy distribution is needed. Smart Grid (SG) facilitates energy providers to distribute electricity efficiently to the user according to their particular requirements. Recent advancements enable SG to monitor, analyze, control and coordinate for the demand and supply of electricity efficiency and energy saving. SG also allows two-way real-time communication between utilities and customers using cloud and Fog enabled infrastructures. SG minimizes management and operations cost, electricity theft, electricity losses, and maximize user comfort by giving the user choice about their energy use. It also facilitates Renewable Energy Resources (RER) and electric vehicles. Blockchain is a promising technology, provides the necessary features to solve most of these issues. Current Issues include saving a large amount of data, deletion, tampering, and revision of data. It also eliminates the necessity of intermediaries. Inherent security, along with the distributed nature, makes it a perfect candidate for improving the overall services. The rules of the smart contract are automatically enforced upon execution. Smart contracts are enhanced in a way that per-unit price is calculated dynamically based upon RER and utilities generated energy units in the overall grid.

To improve the heat dissipation performance and the deployment flexibility of the edge data center, the concept of integrated indirect liquid cooling system for the edge data center server was introduced, and two samples were investigated through the tests. Firstly, the factors affecting the system performance were studied by experiment and numerical simulation. Then, the heat transfer performance, the flow characteristic, and the system's stability were analyzed. Finally, the temperature control ability of the air cooling and liquid cooling server was compared and analyzed by numerical simulation method. The results show that increasing the flow rate improves the heat dissipation performance when the surface temperature and thermal resistance of the chip reduce. But the further increase in flow rate slows down this trend. The heat dissipation performance of the system also reduces with the increase in coolant temperature. Two sets of the cooling systems, which are respectively arranged inside and outside the server, have similar flow characteristics, but the feasibility of the external system server is higher, which is verified by the numerical simulation method.","Thermal management, Liquid cooling, Heat pipe, Thermal performance, Rack server",,

Current methods and data infrastructures for industrial energy savings were comprehensively reviewed to showcase the potential for a more accurate and effective digital twin-based infrastructure for the industry. With a few more development in enabling technologies such as 5G developments, Internet of Things (IoT) standardization, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain 3.0 utilization, it is but a matter of time that the industry will transition towards the digital twin-based approach. Global government efforts and policies are already inclining towards leveraging better industrial energy efficiencies and energy savings. This provides a promising future for the development of a digital twin-based energy-saving system in the industry.

Special vehicles (e.g. police cars, ambulances and fire trucks) often encounter traffic jams when carrying out emergency tasks, which may lead to unexpected consequences (e.g. causing serious damage to our routine and property). In order to ensure that special vehicles can quickly pass through crowded road and arrive at the accident scene in time, this paper proposes a blockchain-based special vehicles priority access guarantee scheme (BSV-PAGS). In BSV-PAGS, we introduce blockchain into the Internet of Things (IoT), and construct a decentralized distributed edge node network based on blockchian, which guarantees the information sharing among the edge nodes as well as processing the data efficiently. The intelligent terminal device will upload the special vehicle information to the edge node in the blockchain, and then the uploaded information will sync to each edge node through the information sharing smart contract, realizing the information sharing among the edge nodes. In addition, we use machine learning method (e.g. Bag of Visual Words and Support Vector Machine) to design and train special vehicle detectors to improve the recognition accuracy of special vehicles. We design a special vehicle priority access smart contract to achieve real-time scheduling of vehicles and ultimately ensure the priority of special vehicles. Then, we carried out a security analysis of BSV-PAGS. Finally, we test a large number of simulation experiments based on Ethereum clients. The experimental results show that our scheme is feasible and effective.","Vehicle scheduling, Internet of Things, Blockchain, Edge computing, Machine learning",,

In the first phase, a secure data aggregation through 6G sensors is performed at the data plane. Then, in the second phase, the aggregated data is sent to the 6G-enabled NFV control plane to leverage resource allocation to connected autonomous smart vehicles (CASVs) through edge nodes via service container operations. In the third phase, management plane operations are designed that includes registration and auction smart contracts (SC) for connected autonomous vehicle owner (CAVO) and CASVs over the BC with public/private pairs fetched from interplanetary file systems (IPFS). The proposed scheme is compared against existing NFV schemes like distant, edge, and SDN-based edge control. At 20 CASVs, 6Blocks achieves an edge-service latency of 0.05ms against 0.76ms, 0.27, and 0.15ms for cloud, edge, and SDN-edge schemes, respectively, with high connection density of 107 nodes, at maximum utilized IPFS bandwidth of 0.2 Mbps. Then, we validate the trust of our model through the automated validation of the internet security protocol and applications (AVISPA) tool and modeled the vehicle and sensor nodes.

Thus, SM can provide a competitive edge for manufacturers that successfully adopt it. In the process of adopting SM, building blocks play a critical role and can be seen as prerequisites. Managers of manufacturing companies are interested in learning what building blocks are relevant and can help make their operations smarter and more competitive. Our paper is a first attempt to answer this question through presenting the most frequently used building blocks for SM adoption. In order to achieve this objective, we conducted a systematic mapping review to identify both building blocks as well as current methods for adopting SM. In a next step, we matched the building blocks with the adoption methods. This matching of building blocks with the adoption methods helped in determining whether a building block actually recommended in the methods for adopting SM. We found that intelligent control, data analytics, IT-based production management systems (e.g., ERP, CAx, etc.), smart products/parts/materials, interoperability, data sharing systems and standards are the most commonly used building blocks for manufacturers that are aligned towards adopting SM. As a consequence, the future manufacturing workforce needs to be prepared to understand analytics, sensors, etc. The results also showed that, although building blocks such as blockchain, robots, visual technology, and 3D printing may find their application in specific manufacturing sectors, overall, they are less commonly associated with SM adoption compared to the other building blocks.","Smart Manufacturing, Building Blocks, Industry 4.0, Intelligent Control, Data Analytics, Additive Manufacturing, IoT","47th SME North American Manufacturing Research Conference, NAMRC 47, Pennsylvania, USA.",

More and more scholars focus on studying trust management and trust evaluation in IoT, but there is few research in ensuring that the feedbacks used in the trust evaluating process is trustworthy. Furthermore, a resource-constrained IoT node does not have enough memory to satisfy the usage of trust computation and maintenance. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a blockchain-based trust management mechanism (BBTM), where the trustworthiness of sensor nodes will be evaluated by the mobile edge nodes. BBTM can create smart contracts for trust computation and verify the computation process. We analyze BBTM performance in terms of trust accuracy, convergence, and resiliency against attacks. In addition, we also compare BBTM with other methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","Blockchain, Internet of Things, Trust computation",,

However, at the same time, various security threats arise due to insecure communication happening among various entities in an IoV-based smart city deployment. To address this issue, we aim to design a novel blockchain-enabled batch authentication scheme in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-envisioned IoV-based smart city deployment. The latest trends and revolutions in technologies incorporate AI/Machine Learning (ML) in blockchaining to produce a secure, efficient and intelligent blockchain based system. The data stored in the blocks in the blockchain are authentic and genuine, which makes the AI/ML algorithms to work at their exceptions in order produce correct predictions on the blockchain data. Through the signing phase of the proposed scheme, each vehicle in a dynamically formed cluster broadcasts a message to its own member and respective road-side unit (RSU). In the proposed scheme, two types of authentication take place: vehicle to vehicle (V2V) authentication allows a vehicle to authenticate its neighbor vehicles in its cluster, while batch authentication permits a group of cluster vehicles to be authenticated by their RSU. At the end, a group key is established among the vehicles and RSU in their cluster. RSU then gathers securely data from its vehicles and form several transactions including the information of vehicles and its own given information to the cluster member vehicles. The transactions are formed later by the nearby fog server associated with RSU and then by the cloud server to form a complete block. The created blocks are mined by the cloud servers in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud server network through the voting-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm. The authentic and genuine data of the blockchain are utilized for Big data analytics through AI/ML algorithms. It is shown that the proposed scheme is highly robust against various attacks through formal and informal security analysis, and also through formal security verification tool. A detailed comparative analysis reveals that the proposed scheme achieves superior security and functionality features, and offers comparable storage, communication and computational costs as compared to other existing competing schemes. Finally, the blockchain implementation has been carried out on the proposed scheme to show its effectiveness.","Internet of Vehicles (IoV), Smart city, Batch authentication, Key agreement, Blockchain, Security, AVISPA",,

According to the existing literature and socio-psychological theories, we examine three specializations of state-dependent susceptibility, that is, stubborn positives scenario, stubborn neutrals scenario, and stubborn extremists scenario. Interactions among agents form a signed graph, in which positive and negative edges represent friendly and antagonistic interactions, respectively. We conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the generalized nonlinear opinion dynamics. For stubborn positives and stubborn neutrals scenarios, the general model is well-posed if and only if the system matrix is diagonally dominant. Based on the property of limit set and the existing results, we obtain some sufficient conditions such that the states of all agents converge to specific equilibrium point or bipartite consensus. For stubborn extremists scenario, by using the Perron--Frobenius property of eventually positive matrices, we establish some sufficient conditions such that the states of all agents converge into the subspace spanned by the right positive eigenvector of an eventually positive matrix. When there exists at least one entry of the equilibrium point or right positive eigenvector which is not equal to one, the derived results can be used to describe different levels of an opinion. In addition, for stubborn extremists scenario, we also consider the cases that the system matrix forms the opposing Laplacian and repelling Laplacian matrix, respectively. Finally, we present two examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical findings.","Opinion dynamics, State-dependent susceptibility, Signed graphs, Limit set, Eventually positive matrices",,

Currently there is a lack of consensus on treatment or interpretation of computed tomography (CT) images for calcaneus fractures. This study proposes a novel computer-assisted method for automated classification and detection of fracture locations in calcaneus CT images using a deep learning algorithm. Methods Two types of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures with different network depths, a Residual network (ResNet) and a Visual geometry group (VGG), were evaluated and compared for the classification performance of CT scans into fracture and non-fracture categories based on coronal, sagittal, and transverse views. The bone fracture detection algorithm incorporated fracture area matching using the speeded-up robust features (SURF) method, Canny edge detection, and contour tracing. Results Results showed that ResNet was comparable in accuracy (98%) to the VGG network for bone fracture classification but achieved better performance for involving a deeper neural network architecture. ResNet classification results were used as the input for detecting the location and type of bone fracture using SURF algorithm. Conclusions Results from real patient fracture data sets demonstrate the feasibility using deep CNN and SURF for computer-aided classification and detection of the location of calcaneus fractures in CT images.","Convolutional neural networks, Calcaneus fracture, Computed tomography image, Residual network, Visual geometry group",,

There are several reasons that this is likely: (1) Although the Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification examination is the standard prolapse staging system used in the Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery field for reporting outcomes, this assessment is not used commonly in clinical care outside the subspecialty; (2) no clinically useful and accepted definition of apical support loss exists, and (3) no consensus or guidelines address the degree of apical support loss at which an apical support procedure should be performed routinely. Objective The purpose of this study was to identify a simple screening measure for significant loss of apical vaginal support. Study Design This was an analysis of women with Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification stage 0-IV prolapse. Women with total vaginal length of ≥7 cm were included to define a population with ``normal'' vaginal length. Univariable and linear regression analyses were used to identify Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification points that were associated with 3 definitions of apical support loss: the International Consultation on Incontinence, the Pelvic Floor Disorders Network revised eCARE, and a Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification point C cut-point developed by Dietz et al. Linear and logistic regression models were created to assess predictors of overall apical support loss according to these definitions. Receiver operator characteristic curves were generated to determine test characteristics of the predictor variables and the areas under the curves were calculated. Results Of 469 women, 453 women met the inclusion criterion. The median Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification stage was III, and the median leading edge of prolapse was +2 cm (range, --3 to 12 cm). By stage of prolapse (0-IV), mean genital hiatus size (genital hiatus; mid urethra to posterior fourchette) increased: 2.0 $\pm$ 0.5, 3.0 $\pm$ 0.5, 4.0 $\pm$ 1.0, 5.0 $\pm$ 1.0, and 6.5 $\pm$ 1.5 cm, respectively (P 3.75 cm was highly predictive of apical support loss (area under the curve, >0.8 in all models). Conclusions Increasing genital hiatus size is associated highly with and predictive of apical vaginal support loss. Specifically, the Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification measurement genital hiatus of ≥3.75 cm is highly predictive of apical support loss by all study definitions. This simple measurement can be used to screen for apical support loss and the need for further evaluation of apical vaginal support before planning a hysterectomy or prolapse surgery.","apical support, genital hiatus, prolapse, screening",,

Specifically, it addresses the addition of stable PFCs on agents that interact with each other using diffusive couplings. The value in the application of such PFC is twofold. Firstly, it has been an issue that output synchronization among passivity-short systems requires global information for the design of controllers in the cases when initial conditions need to be taken into account, such as average consensus and distributed optimization. We show that a stable PFC can be designed to passivate a passivity-short system while its output asymptotically vanishes as its input tends to zero. As a result, output synchronization is achieved among these systems by fully distributed controls without altering the original consensus results. Secondly, in the literature of output synchronization over signed weighted graphs, it is generally required that the graph Laplacian be positive semidefinite, i.e., L≥0 for undirected graphs or L+LT≥0 for balanced directed graphs. We show that the PFC serves as output feedback to the communication graph to enhance the robustness against negative weight edges. As a result, output synchronization is achieved over a signed weighted and balanced graph, even if the corresponding Laplacian is not positive semidefinite.","Parallel feedforward compensator, Output synchronization, Passivity, Signed weighted digraphs, Indefinite Laplacians",,

The installation of land drains not only affects the water balance of a landscape, but also influences the susceptibility to erosion, nutrient cycling, transport of plant protection products (PPPs) and greenhouse gas emissions. Due to the complex nature of environmental systems, the direction in which the substance flows are affected remains unclear, as does the strength of the effects. In this literature review, the focus is on the most relevant site-specific factors that affect the soil moisture regime, erosion, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fluxes, and PPP fluxes under undrained and drained conditions. The considered factors are the topography, soil characteristics, drainage types, rainfall characteristics and land management. Case studies from temperate climate zones represent the basis of the discussion, with a focus on continental Europe and the USA. In most cases, drainage enhances the total annual water flows from arable fields, while the effects on peak flows were variable, with the local topography playing a crucial role. There exists a certain level of consensus in the literature that subsurface drainage methods reduce the risk of erosion, while surface drainage may increase erosion at the edge of drainage channels. Nitrogen fluxes are generally enhanced following drainage. This is especially true for organic soils with large stores of organically bound N and, therefore, a high loss potential. For P losses, the trend goes in the opposite direction, with generally reduced losses seen following drainage installation. Similar findings are expected in relation to PPP losses. However, these trends may reverse on flat terrain, where subsurface drainage may reduce the on-site retention of these compounds. Overall, the literature reveals the patterns by which drainage affects hydrology, nutrient and PPP fluxes, although it is also evident that the combination of site-specific factors is influential. This hence needs to be considered as part of any risk assessment or management decisions.","Erosion, Nitrogen, Peak flow, Phosphorus, Plant protection products, Preferential flow, Runoff",,

We then analyze the algebraic connectivity of such networks, and provide an asymptotically tight rate of growth of this quantity for a certain range of inter-network edge formation probabilities. Next, we give bounds on the smallest eigenvalue of the grounded Laplacian matrix (obtained by removing certain rows and columns of the Laplacian matrix) of random interdependent networks for the case where the removed rows and columns correspond to one of the subnetworks. Finally, we study a property known as r-robustness, which is a strong indicator of the ability of a network to tolerate structural perturbations and dynamical attacks.

This paper, based on the `Back from the edge' project, evaluates the development and implementation of an intervention to reduce and prevent the impact of occupational stress in the RAN workforce in the Northern territory. Methods The methods involved a combined participatory action research/organisational development model, involving seven steps, to develop and implement system changes within the (then) Northern Territory Department of Health and Families (NTDH&F). The development, implementation and evaluation was informed via information from participants collected during workshops and interviews. Pre and post surveys were undertaken to evaluate the study. Results Occupational stress interventions developed by the workgroups were categorised into four main groups: (1) remote context, (2) workload and scope of practice, (3) poor management, and (4) violence and safety concerns. The main interventions centred on promoting a well educated, stable workforce. There were very few measurable changes as a result of the interventions as many were not able to be implemented in the time period of the study, but implementation is continuing.

Extreme waves mainly occur during major storms at sea by means of constructive interference of wave trains or by nonlinear wave interaction, but extreme waves may also be associated with tsunami or meteotsunami events. If they arrive at the coast, most extreme waves have the potential to cause extensive remodeling and repositioning of the shoreline environment and landforms as well as causing significant damage to human infrastructure and threat to life. The impact of extreme waves on both sedimentary and rocky coasts can be substantial with sediments or rocky boulders eroded from the coastal edge being transported and deposited some distance inland. This characteristic provides clues to the nature of the extreme event and, if recorded within the recent sedimentary record, information about the periodicity of similar events. The impact of extreme waves on coastal communities and environment has prompted a range of mitigation and adaptation strategies to cope with these hazards. These include more robust coast defences, better modeling, prediction and warning systems, improved interagency liaison, improved technical assistance, and storm impact management information for the general public, as well as provision of clear evacuation routes during a wave-related emergency. However, since climate change seems likely to result in increased rates of both sea-level rise and storm-related impacts, there is an emerging consensus that adaptive management of the coastal zone may prove to be a more sustainable strategy than the alternatives.","Extreme waves, Impact, Meteotsunami, Mitigation, Prediction, Storm-derived, Tsunami, Vulnerability",,Hazards and Disasters Series

This requires cost-effective techniques to preserve the privacy and the security of model training within the resource-constrained environment. Traditional learning methods rely on the trust among the system for privacy and security. However, with the increase of the learning scale, maintaining every edge device's trustworthiness could be expensive. To cost-effectively establish trust in a trustless environment, this paper proposes democratic learning (DemL), which makes the first step to explore hardware/software co-design for blockchain-secured decentralized on-device learning. By utilizing blockchain's decentralization and tamper-proofing, our design secures AI learning in a trustless environment. To tackle the extra overhead introduced by blockchain, we propose PoMC (an algorithm and architecture co-design) as a novel blockchain consensus mechanism, which first exploits cross-domain reuse (AI learning and blockchain consensus) in AI learning architecture. Evaluation results show our DemL can protect AI learning from privacy leakage and model pollution, and demonstrated that privacy and security come with trivial hardware overhead and power consumption (2%). We believe that our work will open the door of synergizing blockchain and on-device learning for security and privacy.","Architecture/software co-design, Security support, Privacy support, Accelerator, Application-specific system, Emerging computing platform",,

Compared with opinion leaders, structural hole spanners have better locations in social networks to expand the scope of information diffusion. In the past, researchers focused on evolution rules and opinion dynamics environments to monitor and even manage public opinion. In this study, we propose a novel structural-hole-based approach to control public opinion in social networks, hereinafter referred to as the SHCPO approach. We discuss the influence of both ordinary agents and structural hole spanners on opinion evolution using our improved Friedkin--Johnsen (FJ) model. Further, we analyze the evolution tendency of public opinion, which leads to the final consensus of public opinion, via the FJ model with ordinary agents in a community and structural hole spanners in joint communities. We reveal three kinds of connections between structural hole spanners and ordinary agents in joint communities. These comprise structural hole spanners connecting (1) two opinion leaders; (2) two ordinary agents; (3) one opinion leader and one ordinary agent. The three connections will lead to different opinion evolution conditions. According to the structural balance theory, we reconstruct the social network by changing the connections between structural hole spanners and agents in different communities. This guides the public opinion tendencies of joint communities towards the positive. Experimental results demonstrate beneficial effects of the SHCPO approach. We use three evaluation indicators to compare the SHCPO approach to five alternative methods. The percentage of positive opinions is used as an evaluation indicator. The SHCPO approach, compared with adding informed agents, add edges, the method from WWW and varying susceptibility to persuasion method, which guide the agent with a negative opinion towards positive opinion, has improved about 17%, 10%, 9%, 1%, respectively.","Structural holes, Opinion dynamics, Opinion evolution, Social network, Opinion control",,

First, convex hulls are extracted from both point sets. Triangular patches on the surface of convex hulls are specified by predefining their normal vectors, thus guaranteeing that all points are located on the same side of any randomly selected triangle plane. Second, the potential similar triangle pair set is obtained by comparing the length ratio of the edges on the two extracted convex hulls. Thereafter, the transformation parameters for each pairwise triangle are calculated by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the corresponding vertex pairs. Furthermore, a k-dimensional (k-d) tree is used to accelerate the closest point search for the whole point sets. Third, outliers that may lead to significant errors are discarded by integrating the random sample consensus algorithm for global optimization. Experiments show that the proposed 3PCHM is robust even with the existence of noise and outliers and is effective in cases of part-to-part registration and part-to-whole registration.","Convex hull, Point sets, Registration, Shape matching",,

To do so, one of the most natural ways to represent these objects is through attributed graphs. Several existing graph extraction methods could be implemented and thus, numerous graphs, which may not only differ in their nodes and edge structure but also in their attribute domains, could be created from the same object. Afterwards, a matching process is implemented to generate the correspondence between two attributed graphs, and depending on the selected graph matching method, a unique correspondence is generated from a given pair of attributed graphs. The combination of these factors leads to the possibility of a large quantity of correspondences between the two original objects. This paper presents a method that tackles this problem by considering multiple correspondences to conform a single one called a consensus correspondence, eliminating both the incongruences introduced by the graph extraction and the graph matching processes. Additionally, through the application of an online learning algorithm, it is possible to deduce some weights that influence on the generation of the consensus correspondence. This means that the algorithm automatically learns the quality of both the attribute domain and the correspondence for every initial correspondence proposal to be considered in the consensus, and defines a set of weights based on this quality. It is shown that the method automatically tends to assign larger values to high quality initial proposals, and therefore is capable to deduce better consensus correspondences.","Attributed graphs, Graph matching, Consensus correspondence, Online learning",Advances in Graph-based Pattern Recognition,

With learning and updating the relation dynamically, it facilitates modeling the potential dynamic individual facial expressing manner and accordingly improves the AU recognition under the unconstrained environment.

Study Design This is a case-control study. Methods Twenty singers were recorded singing sustained vowels in a ``belting'' quality refined by audio perception as ``Overdrive'' and ``Edge.'' Two studies were performed: (1) a laryngostroboscopic examination using a videonasoendoscopic camera system (Olympus) and the Laryngostrobe program (Laryngograph); (2) a simultaneous recording of the EGG and acoustic signals using Speech Studio (Laryngograph). The images were analyzed based on consensus agreement. Statistical analysis of the acoustic, LTAS, and EGG parameters was undertaken using the Student paired t test. Results The two modes of singing determined by audio perception have visibly different laryngeal gestures: Edge has a more constricted setting than that of Overdrive, where the ventricular folds seem to cover more of the vocal folds, the aryepiglottic folds show a sharper edge in Edge, and the cuneiform cartilages are rolled in anteromedially. LTAS analysis shows a statistical difference, particularly after the ninth harmonic, with a coinciding first formant. The combined group showed statistical differences in shimmer, harmonics-to-noise ratio, normalized noise energy, and mean sound pressure level (P ≤ 0.05). Conclusion ``Belting'' sounds can be categorized using audio perception into two modes of singing: ``Overdrive'' and ``Edge.'' This study demonstrates consistent visibly different laryngeal gestures between these modes and with some correspondingly significant differences in LTAS, EGG, and acoustic measures.","Complete Vocal Technique, Belting, Laryngostroboscopic imaging, Long-term average spectrum",,

In particular, we propose a model of opinion dynamics which takes into account the notions of latitude of acceptance, latitude of noncommitment, and latitude of rejection from social judgment theory. In the proposed model, each individual is considered as a node in a graph, and the influences are represented by edges. The proposed model considers positive (negative) edges for acceptance (rejection), while there is no connection for noncommitment. In addition, in the introduced nonlinear model, the weight of each edge, which represents the influence weight, changes depending on the opinions of the individuals in the network. Given the negative interactions, the influence graph of the network may be initially unbalanced; however, the proposed model presents that such graph seeks balance eventually. Thus, the model introduced in this paper provides a mathematical framework for balance theory introduced by Harary. Through simulations, we show that the proposed model can demonstrate consensus, bipartite consensus, and clustering of opinions.","Opinion dynamics, Bounded confidence model, Social judgment theory, Balance theory",,

In the leader--follower network, the leaders maintain a constant desired state and the followers update their states by communicating with local neighbors over the random communication network.

Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is an MRI technique that is sensitive to chronic active lesions, termed rim + lesions on the QSM. We present QSMRim-Net, a data imbalance-aware deep neural network that fuses lesion-level radiomic and convolutional image features for automated identification of rim + lesions on QSM. Methods QSM and T2-weighted-Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (T2-FLAIR) MRI of the brain were collected at 3 T for 172 MS patients. Rim + lesions were manually annotated by two human experts, followed by consensus from a third expert, for a total of 177 rim + and 3986 rim negative (rim−) lesions. Our automated rim + detection algorithm, QSMRim-Net, consists of a two-branch feature extraction network and a synthetic minority oversampling network to classify rim + lesions. The first network branch is for image feature extraction from the QSM and T2-FLAIR, and the second network branch is a fully connected network for QSM lesion-level radiomic feature extraction. The oversampling network is designed to increase classification performance with imbalanced data. Results On a lesion-level, in a five-fold cross validation framework, the proposed QSMRim-Net detected rim + lesions with a partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (pROC AUC) of 0.760, where clinically relevant false positive rates of less than 0.1 were considered. The method attained an area under the precision recall curve (PR AUC) of 0.704. QSMRim-Net out-performed other state-of-the-art methods applied to the QSM on both pROC AUC and PR AUC. On a subject-level, comparing the predicted rim + lesion count and the human expert annotated count, QSMRim-Net achieved the lowest mean square error of 0.98 and the highest correlation of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.92). Conclusion This study develops a novel automated deep neural network for rim + MS lesion identification using T2-FLAIR and QSM images.","Multiple sclerosis, Quantitative susceptibility mapping, Chronic active lesions, Convolutional neural network, Radiomic features",,

The scheme addresses the research gaps of fixed static allocation for miners to perform computationally intensive mining tasks through a multi-hop computational offloading (CO) scheme and addresses an auction mechanism for a fair bidding process among the miner nodes. The scheme operates in three phases. In the first phase, a multi-hop CO scheme with a fair incentive policy is formulated for miners. The CO schemes offer guaranteed offloading services to mobile devices from far-edge systems through a chain of neighbor nodes. Then, in the second phase, MaaS is proposed to leverage expensive mining tasks through 5G-enabled pico/femtocells. Integration of 5G allows massive end-to-end device and service connectivity. As IIoT ecosystems have limited memory and compute requirements, MaaS assures that the proposed consensus has a responsive validation and mining time. To make the data exchange in the consensus process lightweight, and allow a large number of sensors to share the data in a lightweight manner, an effective consensus mechanism Lightweight Proof-of-Proximity (LPoP), is proposed that forms group validations instead of single block validation. The data is exchanged through javascript object notation (JSON) format, maintaining a steady transaction rate. MB-MaaS is compared against the existing scheme for parameters bid thresholds and request servicing times, and mining and consensus formation. For example, the request serving time at 12 requests is improved by 56.78%, and a significant improvement of 26.47% is observed for processed blocks; parsing time on average is improved by 7.89%. The comparative analysis suggests that the scheme is more efficient than other competing approaches.","Mobile blockchain, Mobile edge computing, 5G, Mining-as-a-Service, Data offloading",,

In doing so, DeGroot's consensus model has served as the popular choice for modeling the information diffusion and opinion formation in social networks. Achieving a trade-off between the cost associated with modifications made to the network and the speed of convergence to the desired state has shown to be a critical factor. This has been treated as the Fastest Mixing Markov Chain (FMMC) problem over a graph with given transition probabilities over a subset of edges. Addressing this multi-objective optimization problem over the friendship graph, this paper has provided the corresponding Pareto optimal points or the Pareto frontier. In the case of friendship graph with at least three blades, it is shown that the Pareto frontier is reduced to a global minimum point which is same as the optimal point corresponding to the minimum spanning tree of the friendship graph, i.e., the star topology. Furthermore, a lower limit for transition probabilities among friends has been provided, where values higher than this limit do not have any impact on the convergence rate.","Multi-objective optimization, Pareto frontier, Reversible Markov chain, Friendship graph, DeGroot consensus, Semidefinite programming",,

The mineralized portion of the skeleton appears to grow only by apposition, adding material at the edges of each tessera; maintenance of non-mineralized joints between tesserae is therefore vital, with precise control of mineral deposition and inhibition at the many thousands of growth fronts in the skeleton. Yet, we have only scattered evidence as to how the elasmobranchs mineralize and grow their skeletons. In this review, we take an ``environment to skeleton'' approach, drawing together research from a vast range of perspectives to track calcium and phosphate from the typical elasmobranch habitats into and through the body, to their deposition at tesseral growth fronts. In the process, we discuss the available evidence for skeletal resorption capability, mineral homeostasis hormones, and nucleation inhibition mechanisms. We also outline relevant theories in crystal nucleation and typical errors in measurements of serum calcium and phosphate in the study of vertebrate biology. We assemble research that suggests consensus in some concepts in elasmobranch skeletal development, but also highlight the very large gaps in our knowledge, particularly in regards to endocrine functional networks and biomineralization mechanisms. In this way, we lay out frameworks for future directions in the study of elasmobranch skeletal biology with stronger and more comparative links to research in other disciplines and into other taxa.","Biomineralization, Tesserae, Elasmobranch, Skeleton, Apatite, Tessellated cartilage",Biomineralisation & Motorisation of pathogens,

To address the problems, this study presents a semi-automated approach that can obtain required parameters to create as-built BIMs for steel structures with complex connections from terrestrial laser scanning data. An algorithm based on principal component analysis (PCA) and cross-section fitting techniques is developed to retrieve the position and direction of each circular structural component from scanning data. An image-assisted edge point extraction algorithm is developed to effectively extract the boundaries of planar structural components. Normal-based region growing algorithm and random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm are adopted to model the connections between structural components. The proposed approach was validated on a bridge-like steel structure with four different types of structural components. The extracted as-built geometry was compared with the as-designed geometry to validate the accuracy of the proposed approach. The results showed that the proposed approach could efficiently and accurately extract the geometry information and generate parametric BIMs of steel structures.","Building information model (BIM), Terrestrial laser scanning, As-built geometric modeling",,

In this context, age and extra-hematological morbidity are of primary importance, but performance status and overall functionality related to geriatric age, as physical abilities, cognitive aspects and ability to self-management are not negligible. Thus, a defined multi-dimensional assessment is needed to differentiate between fit, unfit and frail older adults (Klepin ASH Education Program 2014). We propose a tool to evaluate the tolerance to more or less intensive treatments in over 60 years aged patients, and to estimate the impact on the outcome. Our algorithm is based on 4 main variables universally recognized: age, performance status, comorbidities and geriatric aspects (functional, physical and cognitive). 1- As regards age, two cut-off values were considered: 70-years limit because it represents the threshold below which the allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may still run; and the 85-year limit because it denotes the edge beyond which chemotherapy (also non-intensive) should not be administered. 2- About performance status, it was chosen the ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) scale more or equal to 3 as the limit beyond which chemotherapy should be avoided. 3- Considering co-morbidities, the SIE, SIES GITMO group consensus-based definition of inability to intensive and non-intensive chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (Ferrara et al. Leukemia 2013) was chosen to identify both patients candidate to intensive or candidate to only non-intensive chemotherapy. 4- Approaching the geriatric assessment, two levels of impairment were considered: the most important level of seriousness occurs when the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) functional scale is not overtaken; the lowest level of seriousness is verified if at least one among the functional Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale or the physical Short Physical Performace Battery (SPPB) scale or the cognitive Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale are not overcome. The stratification of patients works with some steps that must be excluded in order to get over the various levels of fitness (Figure 1). We call this approach the NO-chain algorithm. It foresees that: - Patient with at least one of the following features are considered frail: 85 or more years of age; at least 3 of ECOG; assessed functional impairment with the ADL scale <3; presence of major comorbidities including at least one of the six criteria, according to the SIE, SIES GITMO consensus-based definition of inability to non-intensive chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia. - Not-frail patient with at least one of the following features are considered unfit: age over 70 years; at least one of criteria, according to the SIE, SIES GITMO consensus-based definition of inability to intensive chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia; at least one among functional impairment assessed by IADL scale <4 or reduced physical performance by SPPB scale <9 or intellectual deficit by the MMSE scale <24. - All patients who get through all these steps are considered fit and potentially eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Although the used cut-off levels might need amelioration in the practice, the basic principle of this algorithm is the definition of fitness actually correlated to the patient's condition in itself, regardless of the hematological disease. The algorithm was originally developed for elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but subsequently applied to patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and to the other hematological malignancies. The application is undoubtedly different, depending on the disease the patient is affected by and its classification. For instance: an AML frail patients, regardless of biological risk, can be candidate only to supportive care; a low-risk MDS frail patients may still be candidate to pharmacological therapy as erythropoiesis stimulating agents or iron chelation therapy. The validation of this algorithm has to be carried out within each hematologic malignancy and must take into account the specific application.

In this paper, a decentralized optimization model for the trading community formation is proposed based on the Lp-box consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), where the network features of the physical systems are explicitly represented by power loss and wheeling charging in local and regional trading level, respectively. The framework for multi-level hybrid trading network construction is introduced involving three different trading modes, i.e, traditional trading mode, agent-based trading mode and peer-to-peer (P2P) trading mode, and two hybrid trading networks, namely Traditional trading & Agent based trading (TA) and Traditional trading & Peer-to-peer trading & Agent based trading (TPA), are developed based on the trading community formation results. The corresponding profit allocation schemes are also presented for the TA and TPA hybrid trading networks respectively. A set of complex network indices is applied to analyze the network characteristics of the TA and TPA trading topologies, while the link entropy (LE) index is used to evaluate the edge significance of the communication relationship network in maintaining global connectivity. Finally, the proposed models are validated via a test system with six IEEE 33-bus systems connected through the IEEE 9-bus system. The results show that the agent-based strategy can benefit all entities compared with the SDR and contribution-based strategies, while the REO (renewable energy output)-first strategy proposed for P2P pairing is more stimulating for the selling entities with larger REOs than distance-first mode. In addition, the entities' prices in the bi-level trading are significantly improved compared with those of the single-level trading both for agent-based trading and P2P trading. The complex index values of TA are all slightly greater than those of TPA, and a feeder with fewer managers is likely to have a larger LE value. The proposed models for trading community formation and trading network formation provide significant means for the development of sustainable LEMs.","Local energy trading, Trading community formation, Hybrid trading network, P2P trading, Agent-based trading",,

Due to large differences in the phenomena measured by these modalities, the assumptions necessary to make inferences about axonal connections, and the limitations accompanying each, brain connectivity remains an elusive concept. Despite this, only a handful of studies have directly compared connectivity as inferred from multiple modalities, and there remains much ambiguity over what the term is actually referring to as a biological construct. Here, we perform a direct comparison based on the high-resolution and high-contrast Enhanced Nathan Klein Institute (NKI) Rockland Sample neuroimaging data set, and the CoCoMac database of tract tracing studies. We compare four types of commonly-used primate connectivity analyses: tract tracing experiments, compiled in CoCoMac; group-wise correlation of cortical thickness; tractographic networks computed from diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI); and correlational networks obtained from resting-state BOLD (fMRI). We find generally poor correspondence between all four modalities, in terms of correlated edge weights, binarized comparisons of thresholded networks, and clustering patterns. fMRI and DWI had the best agreement, followed by DWI and CoCoMac, while other comparisons showed striking divergence. Networks had the best correspondence for local ipsilateral and homotopic contralateral connections, and the worst correspondence for long-range and heterotopic contralateral connections. k-Means clustering highlighted the lowest cross-modal and cross-species consensus in lateral and medial temporal lobes, anterior cingulate, and the temporoparietal junction. Comparing the NKI results to those of the lower resolution/contrast International Consortium for Brain Imaging (ICBM) dataset, we find that the relative pattern of intermodal relationships is preserved, but the correspondence between human imaging connectomes is substantially better for NKI. These findings caution against using ``connectivity'' as an umbrella term for results derived from single empirical modalities, and suggest that any interpretation of these results should account for (and ideally help explain) the lack of multimodal correspondence.","Connectomics, Tract tracing, CoCoMac, Resting state functional MRI, Cortical thickness, Structural covariance, Diffusion-weighted MRI, Hierarchical clustering, -Means clustering",,

A critical issue of such interactions is given by the strategy of protein search for specific targets on DNA. The mechanisms by which the protein are able to find relatively small cognate sequences, typically 15--20 base pairs (bps) for repressors, and 4--6 bps for restriction enzymes among the millions of bp of non-specific chromosomal DNA have hardly engaged researchers for decades. Recent experimental studies have generated new insights on the basic processes of protein-DNA interactions evidencing the underlying complex dynamic phenomena involved, which combine three-dimensional and one-dimensional motion along the DNA chain. It has been demonstrated that protein molecules have an extraordinary ability to find the target very quickly on the DNA chain, in some cases, with two orders of magnitude faster than the diffusion limit. This unique property of protein-DNA search mechanism is known as facilitated diffusion. Several theoretical mechanisms have been suggested to describe the origin of facilitated diffusion. However, none of such models currently has the ability to fully describe the protein search strategy. In this paper, we suggest that the ability of proteins to identify consensus sequences on DNA is based on the entanglement of π-π electrons between DNA nucleotides and protein amino acids. The π-π entanglement is based on Quantum Walk (QW), through Coin-position entanglement (CPE). First, the protein identifies a dimer belonging to the consensus sequence, and localize a π on such dimer, hence, the other π electron scans the DNA chain until the sequence is identified. Focusing on the example of recognition of consensus sequences of EcoRV or EcoRI, we will describe the quantum features of QW on protein-DNA complexes during the search strategy, such as walker quadratic spreading on a coherent superposition of different vertices and environment-supported long-time survival probability of the walker. We will employ both discrete- or continuous-time versions of QW. Biased and unbiased classical Random Walk (CRW) have been used for a long time to describe the Protein-DNA search strategy. QW, the quantum version of CRW, has been widely studied for its applications in quantum information applications. In our biological application, the walker (the protein) resides at a vertex in a graph (the DNA structural topology). Differently to CRW, where the walker moves randomly, the quantum walker can hop along the edges in the graph to reach other vertices entering coherently a superposition across different vertices spreading quadratically faster than CRW analogous evidencing the typical speed up features of the QW. When applied to a protein-DNA target search problem, QW gives the possibility to achieve the experimental diffusional motion of proteins over diffusion classical limits experienced along DNA chains exploiting quantum features such as CPE and long-time survival probability supported by the environment. In turn, we come to the conclusion that, under quantum picture, the protein search strategy does not distinguish between one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) cases.","Protein-DNA binding selection, Classical random and quantum walk, Coin-position entanglement, Restriction enzymes EcoRV EcoRI, GATATC GAATTC sequences",,

Understanding how asymmetric uplift influences the drainage divide, and therefore mountain asymmetry, is one of the preconditions for extracting tectonic information from topography. However, there is no consensus on this fundamental problem. Here we combined analytical solutions and numerical landscape evolution modeling to examine the impact of two key parameters (uplift gradient, and ratio of uplift rates at two edges) on mountain asymmetry. We followed the convention by assuming uniform gradient of uplift rate and erosion coefficient across the drainage divide. Our analytical approach and numerical simulations show that mountain asymmetry is not always controlled by the uplift gradient as previously suggested; instead, it is governed by the ratio of uplift rates at two edges across the divide. We quantified the relationship between the normalized divide location and the ratio of uplift rates. We applied the new formula to two natural examples to reconstruct the tectonics from the locations of the drainage divides. Moreover, we compared the influences of vertical and horizontal movements on the mountain asymmetry in different situations. The result suggests that in mountain belt with weak tectonic activity or high erosion coefficient, the mountain asymmetry is mainly controlled by the ratio of uplift rates.","Drainage divide, Mountain asymmetry, Numerical modeling, Landscape evolution, Asymmetric uplift, Tectonic geomorphology",,

This approach is also utilized for mathematical modeling of the resting-state brain dynamics, where the applied brain parcellation plays an essential role in deriving the model network and governing the modeling results. There is however no consensus and empirical evidence on how a given brain atlas affects the model outcome, and the choice of parcellation is still rather arbitrary. Accordingly, we explore the impact of brain parcellation on inter-subject and inter-parcellation variability of model fitting to empirical data. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive empirical evidence of potential influences of parcellation choice on resting-state whole-brain dynamical modeling. We show that brain atlases strongly influence the quality of model validation and propose several variables calculated from empirical data to account for the observed variability. A few classes of such data variables can be distinguished depending on their inter-subject and inter-parcellation explanatory power.","Brain atlas, Whole-brain model, Resting-state brain dynamics, Simulations, Brain connectome, Model validation",,

It suggests that the variable coupling weights merely enhance or weaken the communication capacity among the nodes, while do not essentially change the structure of sensing graph. It hence gives some insight into the balance between performance index and configuration budget. Moreover, compared with the infinite precision computation algorithm, our quantization-based triggering rule is concretely designed to explore mild consensus criteria.

The physical and communication digraphs are generally different and the combination of these two graphs forms a cyber-physical system. The interactions between physical and communication graphs are the focus of this paper. We consider different interactions between two graphs, including the case when their pinned Laplacian commutes, the case of the communication graph with diagonalizable pinned Laplacian, and the case of two general graphs. Moreover, within each graph, the relations between the agents can be either collaborative or antagonistic. To capture this, the theory of bipartite consensus is used. Coordination protocols for different cases are designed that are distributed with respect to the communication graph, and overcome the detrimental effects of the signed physical graph. The proposed control methods are illustrated by simulation examples.","Consensus, Bipartite consensus, Multi-agent systems, Two interaction graphs",,

With the aid of adaptive updating parameters, the two protocols do not utilize the minimum eigenvalue of Laplacian matrix, and can deal with the nonlinear dynamics of Lur'e systems in a fully distributed manner. Moreover, with the Lyapunov analysis framework, the tracking errors can be proved to converge to zero in both cases.

This paper proposes the Markov clustering ensemble (MCE) model to solve the weak stability and robustness of soft clustering ensemble. First, the base clustering algorithms are regarded as new features of the original datasets. Then, the results of the base clustering algorithms are the values of these features, which can break through the framework of consensus cluster ensemble. Second, as the base clustering results are discrete data, the maximum information coefficient is applied to measure their similarity. Accordingly, a graph-based cluster ensemble model can be constructed with row vectors as vertices and the similarity between row vectors as edges. Then, the Markov process can be applied to infer the graph-based cluster ensemble model; therefore, the MCE algorithm is designed according to the inference. To test the performance of the MCE algorithm, clustering algorithms and clustering ensemble algorithms are used to conduct comparative experiments on ten datasets. The experimental results show that the MCE algorithm outperforms the other algorithms in terms of accuracy and purity.","Machine learning, Unsupervised learning, Markov clustering ensemble model, Markov clustering ensemble algorithm",,

Participants were surveyed beforehand about challenges facing stroke recovery and results were tabulated as a word cloud. An interactive, design-thinking exercise was conducted that involved completing workbooks, hands-on prototype designing, and presentations, which were then analyzed through qualitative content analysis using an inductive approach. High frequency words in the word cloud of survey responses included access, fragmented, and uncertainty. Qualitative analysis revealed 6 major challenge themes including poor (1) transitions in and (2) access to care; (3) barriers to health insurance; (4) lack of patient support; (5) knowledge gaps; and (6) lack of standardized outcomes. Eleven unique solutions were proposed that centered around new technologies, health care system changes, and the creation of new support roles. Analysis of the alignment between the challenges and solutions revealed that the single proposed solution that solved the most identified challenges was a ``comprehensive stroke clinic with follow-up programs, cutting edge treatments, patient advocation and research.''

There is a consensus that hip dysplasia with a lateral center edge angle (LCEA) less than18$ ^\circ$ should be treated with realignment of acetabular coverage by acetabular osteotomy, but there is controversy whether milder, borderline dysplasia with an LCEA between 18$ ^\circ$ and 25$ ^\circ$ should be treated with arthroscopy or acetabular reorientation. Identifying whether the problem is related to dysplasia or femoroacetabular impingement syndrome is essential, and a crucial factor is whether the hip is unstable. A femoroepiphyseal acetabular roof (FEAR) index with a cutoff value of 2 predicts hip stability with 90% probability, even with a normative LCEA. In addition, according to the anterior-wall index (AWI), the anterior acetabular border should cross onto the middle third of the medial femoral head radius on a line that runs parallel to the femoral neck axis through the center of the femoral head. A reduced AWI suggests a deficient anterior rim. Next, lateral labrum length correlates with the FEAR index and anterior labrum length with AWI, i.e., anterior dysplasia. Consequently, the lateral labrum increases in size with progressive instability, and the anterior labrum increases in size with decreased anterior coverage. Threshold values for labrum size should be defined to guide clinical decision making. Ultimately, we require an algorithm to guide arthroscopy versus bony correction.",,,

Maximizing this smallest eigenvalue has applications to selecting input nodes in order to guarantee consensus of networks with negative edges as well as maximizing the convergence rate of distributed systems. We develop a submodular optimization approach to maximizing the smallest eigenvalue by first proving that positivity of the eigenvalues of a submatrix can be characterized using the probability distribution of the quadratic form induced by the submatrix. We then exploit that connection to prove that positive-definiteness of a submatrix can be expressed as a constraint on a submodular function. We prove that our approach results in polynomial-time algorithms with provable bounds on the size of the submatrix. We also present generalizations to non-symmetric matrices, alternative sufficient conditions for the smallest eigenvalue to exceed a desired bound that are valid for Laplacian matrices, and a numerical evaluation.","Eigenvalues, Optimization, Distributed control, Networked control, Submodularity, Networks, Matrix algebra",,

To study the distribution of preferences that emerge in such situations, a useful approach is to simulate opinion dynamics on top of complex networks, composed by nodes (individuals) and their connections (edges), where the state of each node can be one amongst several opinions including the undecided state. We analyze two different dynamics: the one proposed by Travieso and Fontoura (TF) and the plurality rule (PR), which are paradigmatic of outflow and inflow dynamics, respectively. We are specially interested in the impact of the network randomness on the final distribution of opinions. For that purpose, we consider Watts--Strogatz networks, which possess the small-world property, and where randomness is controlled by a probability p of adding random shortcuts to an initially regular network. Depending on the value of p, the average connectivity 〈k〉, and the initial conditions, the final distribution can be basically (i) consensus, (ii) coexistence of different options, or (iii) predominance of indecision. We find that, in both dynamics, the predominance of a winning opinion is favored by increasing the number of reconnections (shortcuts), promoting consensus. In contrast to the TF case, in the PR dynamics, a fraction of undecided nodes can persist in the final state. In such cases, a maximum number of undecided nodes occurs within the small-world range of p, due to ties in the decision group.","Complex networks, Small-world, Opinion dynamics, Computer simulations",,

Exacerbated by high path-loss and low UL to DL duration ratio in the 5G new radio time division duplex (TDD-NR) spectrum, the UL capacity is much smaller than that of the DL one. To overcome such a problem, a DL--UL decoupled access (DUDe) approach has been proposed, in which the users are allowed to connect to different base-stations (BSs) at different frequency bands in each link direction. Moreover, DUDe can be an add-on to many 5G (and beyond) technologies, such as millimeter-wave communication, multi-connectivity, device-to-device (D2D) communication, cellular-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication, and mobile edge computing (MEC). However, despite the apparent consensus on its advantages, the realization of DUDe in 5G networks is in its infancy and still requires more efforts from both academia and industry.

Although some studies have given some methods for green supplier selection, the consensus problem has not been sufficiently studied in the existing methods. In order to solve this problem, we propose a group consensus decision making framework to help choosing the best green supplier for electronics manufacturing. Firstly, decision makers' preferences between the alternatives considered with respect to each criterion are elicited by the paired comparison method, and expressed as probabilistic linguistic preference relations. Secondly, a new consistency measure is defined and a convergent algorithm is described to aid the consistency improvement process in a given probabilistic linguistic preference relation. The algorithm adopts a local revision strategy and can be easily interpreted. Further, for the consensus model, in each round of this dynamic and interactive model, the most incompatible expert is asked to revise his/her judgment according to judgment feedback mechanism. If the expert rejects the suggestion, his/her weight of importance will be decreased based on the weighting feedback mechanism. Finally, a case study of selecting green supplier is provided to illustrate the application of the proposed group consensus decision making framework.","Green supplier selection, Probabilistic linguistic preference relations, Consistency, Consensus decision making",,

The structure of functional connectivity networks is strongly affected by signal processing procedures to remove the effects of motion, physiological noise and other sources of experimental error. However, in the absence of an established ground truth, it is difficult to determine the optimal procedure, and no consensus has been reached on the most effective approach to remove nuisance signals without unduly affecting the network intrinsic structural features. Here, we use a novel information-theoretic approach, based on von Neumann entropy, which provides a measure of information encoded in the networks at different scales. We also define a measure of distance between networks, based on information divergence, and optimal null models appropriate for the description of functional connectivity networks, to test for the presence of nontrivial structural patterns that are not the result of simple local constraints. This formalism enables a scale-resolved analysis of the distance between a functional connectivity network and its maximally random counterpart, thus providing a means to assess the effects of noise and image processing on network structure. We apply this novel approach to address a few open questions in the analysis of brain functional connectivity networks. Specifically, we demonstrate a strongly beneficial effect of network sparsification by removal of the weakest links, and the existence of an optimal threshold that maximizes the ability to extract information on large-scale network structures. Additionally, we investigate the effects of different degrees of motion at different scales, and compare the most popular processing pipelines designed to mitigate its deleterious effect on functional connectivity networks. We show that network sparsification, in combination with motion correction algorithms, dramatically improves detection of large scale network structure.","Resting-state, Null models, Threshold, Motion correction, Graph theory, Spectral entropy",,

Revisiting the synchronization controllers that address unknown parameters via adaptive techniques, this work proposes a modification to the synchronization weights employed to enforce state agreement amongst the networked spacecraft. By augmenting a standard adaptive controller that accounts for unknown parameters, with adaptation of the synchronization weights, one opts to improve spacecraft synchronization. The interconnection strengths of the network nodes, responsible for enforcing synchronization amongst spacecraft, are weighted dynamically in proportion to the disagreement between the spacecraft states. Additionally, when all spacecraft are assumed identical, differing only in their orientation and initial conditions, a modification of the standard adaptive parameter laws allows to reach parameter consensus via a dynamic penalization on the pairwise differences of parameter estimates. The proposed adaptive control architecture which allows for adaptation of both parameter uncertainties and synchronization penalty terms is demonstrated via numerical studies of a four-spacecraft network with limited connectivity. As an alternative to the dynamic adjustment of the synchronization gains, a scheme is proposed to optimally select these gains. By considering the sum of deviation-from-the-mean and rotational kinetic energy as appropriate metrics for synchronization, the numerical studies provide insights into the selection of optimal edge-dependent synchronization gains when the initial conditions are assumed available.","Spacecraft formation, Adaptive attitude synchronization, Adaptive consensus gains, Adaptive estimation, Lagrangian adaptive control, Tuning of interconnection strengths",,

When operating by themselves, it has been shown that these devices can provide individual benefits, maintaining some level of convenience, grid stability, and quality of life. However, a clean and sustainable energy future requires the coordinated control of these edge devices on a large scale with state-of-the art control and optimization theory innovation integrated with abundant sensor information. In this work, we take a step toward this vision by proposing a method to explore whether two different types of devices can coordinate to reach consensus on a global objective while continuing to provide their individual benefits. Due to their high impact on the grid and quality of life, this proof-of-concept work focuses on the optimal control of buildings and electric vehicle charging. It is shown that the novel algorithm, termed Network Lasso - Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers - Limited Communication Distributed Model Predictive Control (NALD), successfully achieves the global objective by tracking a power reference from the grid. Simultaneously, the peak electric vehicle charging load is minimized while fully charging each electric vehicle and the internal building temperature is regulated within specified temperature bounds. Results indicate that this can be achieved in the selected example consisting of three charging stations and one large office building.","Distributed optimization, Model predictive building control, Integration, Consensus charging station control, Coordination, Grid stability",,

There is a common consensus, that the size of impacting rain drops has a governing effect on the added damage. However, the literature lacks systematic experimental studies on the topic. In the present paper the effects of drop sizes in Rain Erosion Tests (RET) are studied for a commercial polyurethane based top coat applied to glass fiber-epoxy specimens. The tests are conducted applying a whirling arm RET at impact velocities ranging from 90 to 150 m/s and with four different rain field setups generating mean droplet diameters of 0.76 mm, 1.90 mm, 2.38 mm and 3.50 mm respectively. The time to damage at the end of incubation is determined by inspection of photographs captured inline at regular intervals through the test. Data sets of time to damage as function of local rotor velocity are extracted for each of the four different rain fields. From this data VQ curves (V for Velocity, Q for Quantity) are presented for different representations of quantity, namely specific impacts (DNV GL), specific impacts (ASTM) and accumulated impingement. The slope of the velocity-impingement (VH) curves vary with drop size. We propose a drop size dependent empirical model for impingement (H) to damage as function of impact velocity (v), H (v) = cv−m, where the scale parameter m and the shift parameter c are functions of the drop size. The drop size-dependent impingement model is then applied for computing the expected leading edge lifetime of a virtual 15 MW IEA reference turbine at 18 different meteorological stations in Northern Europe based on 10-min time series of rain intensity and wind speeds observed during several years. The drop size dependent model predicted on average 2.35 times longer lifetime compared to models based on the standard 2.38 mm drop size. Comparing the sites, the model shows a factor 3 variation of added damage per meter of accumulated rain between sites because of differences in concurrent wind during the rain events.","Rain erosion test, Impingement to end of incubation, Drop-size dependency, Wind turbine blade coating, Site specific lifetime modelling, Phenomenological damage model",,

The multi-frame LiDAR point cloud data of the calibration triangular board are recorded. The scanned points with close angles are defined a cluster within same degrees. Furthermore, accurate points are preserved using statistical filtering based on Gaussian distribution. Afterwards, the plane and edge parameters of the triangular board are estimated by the reserved point cloud using improved the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to obtain the 3D locations of the vertices. Meanwhile, corner points in the image can be extracted manually. Finally, the projection matrix between the camera and the LiDAR is estimated by using the 2D--3D​ correspondences in different positions. The projection errors of different frames and corresponding points are calculated. The results demonstrate that the average error with 300 frames is reduced by 23.05% compared to 1 frame. Moreover, the standard deviation diminishes with the increasing of corresponding points. The reliability and advantage of the method are verified compared with other state-of-art methods. It provides theoretical and technical support for low resolution LiDAR.","LiDAR, Color camera, Statistical filtering, Adjacent points, Improved RANSAC method",,

In the proposed method, each agent sends its state to a neighbor agent based on the edge-based event-triggering mechanism. We consider a consensus-based subgradient algorithm with a projection to the constraint set so that states of all agents asymptotically converge to an optimal solution. Simulation results confirm that the proposed event-triggered subgradient algorithm can effectively reduce the number of communications compared with the time-triggered algorithm.","distributed optimization, event-triggered communication, cooperative control, multi-agent systems",20th IFAC World Congress,

In order to stratify the risk of patients and approaching RT sessions appropriately, a consensus document from Associazione Italiana Aritmologia e Cardiostimolazione (AIAC), Associazione Italiana Radioterapia Oncologica (AIRO), Associazione Italiana Fisica Medica (AIFM) has been published on the International Journal of Cardiology in 2018. Along this line, the AIFM working group is promoting specific measurements to better investigate the role of RT on CIED. Methods In Consensus document potential radiation interactions on CIED such as recommendations for the estimation of the dose to the device are described and a multidisciplinary review of in vivo and in vitro data is presented. Further, a multi-center study to evaluate IGRT dose, neutron contamination assessment, and photon out-of-field dose are still being performed. To measure out-of-field dose to CIEDs two phantoms were created and sent to centers working with different treatment planning systems (TPS). Results Preliminary results show that the use of daily CBCT can add a considerable contribution to CIED dose up to 50 cGy like lung 4D protocol. Neutron contamination of photon and electron beams of energies ranging from 6 to 18 MV measured with REM counters show that neutron production for 10 MV photon beam is not negligible. It confirms that neutron produced by electron beam has to be taken into account for beam energy higher than 15 MeV. Comparisons between calculated and measured out-of-filed dose along with examining the behavior of different dosimeters are being studied. Working group is performing measurement to confirm that, in absence of out-of-field TPS commissioning, in vivo dosimetry is still recommended in the case of short distance CIED-field edge or dose close to 2 Gy. Conclusions A detailed approach for safe management of RT patients with CIEDs is now available with important implications for clinical practice. Only a multidisciplinary approach between medical physicists, radiation oncologists and electrophysiologists can really reduce the risk of malfunctions in patient with CIED undergoing RT. Results of the AIFM working group try to provide valuable support and further indications in this regard.",,Abstracts from the 2nd European Congress of Medical Physics,

However, existing studies only models communication interaction between agents as either fixed or switching topologies described by crisp graphs supported by algebraic graph theories. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to describing agent interactions using fuzzy graphs. Our approach is aimed at opening up new research avenues and defining new problems in coordination control especially in terms of dynamics between agents' states, graph topologies and coordination objectives. This paper studies distributed coordination on fuzzy graphs where the edge-weights modeling network topologies are dependent on the states of the agents in the network. In hindsight, the network weights are adjustable based on the situational state of the agents. First, we introduce the concept of fuzzy graphs and give some distinguishing features from the crisp or fixed graphs. Next, we provide some membership functions to define the state-dependent weights and finally we use some simulations to demonstrate the convergence of the proposed consensus algorithms especially for cases where the agents are subject to system failures.",,,

Firstly, a fully distributed event-triggered consensus protocol is proposed by assigning a time-varying coupling weight for each edge. Then by introducing an additional internal dynamic variable, a dynamic adaptive event condition is skillfully constructed and Zeno behavior is also successfully excluded. Based on this, the asymptotic consensus is eventually achieved and the frequency of communication among agents is significantly reduced. Finally, one simulation example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","Consensus, event-triggered, multi-agent system, adaptive control",21st IFAC World Congress,

Patient health data can be acquired locally from devices that can be used to make real-time decisions based on the data. For many years, several hospitals have deployed IoT in their patient rooms and their body parts. IoT devices could be vulnerable to hacking due to a lack of authentication and encryption policies, posing serious hazards to consumers. As a result, blockchain is useful for securing and proving transactions in the IoT. As a result, it is proposed that the problem be solved using Fog Computing (FGC), Edge Computing, and blockchain. Based on FGC technology, models of analysis, and a signature-encryption algorithm (SE), a three-tiered architecture is employed for the identification, verification, and identification of healthcare IoT devices. The generated findings are used to assess the suggested innovative SE algorithm. We discovered that FGC-based blockchain performed better for detecting malicious nodes in terms of packet error rate, reliability, and throughput when compared to cloud settings and other environments.","Blockchain, Cloud computing, Fog Computing, Patient Health Record, Security, Internet of Things",,
