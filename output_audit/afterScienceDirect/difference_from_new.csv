Factors impacting CY improvement include rising population, water shortage, fertilizer use, climate change and unprecedented insect attacks. To resolve these issues, a smart agriculture technique is proposed in this work. Internet of Things (IoT) sensor devices are used to collect data from farms, following which the fuzzy association rule-based classification technique classifies the data into two, valuable and nonvaluable. An improved artificial neural network (IANN) algorithm is applied to identify and analyze the factors involved in monitoring CY's. Thereafter, all valuable data pertaining to the type of seed, fertilizer and crop cost is stored in blocks to secure data and communication between members of the farming community. Finally, an edge computing device is used to store the blocks and transfer information. The valuable data collected is classified using the fuzzy association rule and analyzed using the IANN technique, both of which facilitate a comparison with the historical data so as to enable better decision making in terms of seed and fertilizer selection. Similarly, crop price is predicted through a comparison of present and historical yields. To overcome breaches in security, a blockchain technique is employed in this work to secure communication between farmers, investors and merchants. The investor dispatches instructions on the selection of the seed and fertilizer, as well as the crop cost, through the blockchain to the farmer and the merchant. Such secure communication bypasses third-party involvement and inconsistencies in the data. When compared to the traditional method, the proposed technique offers better accuracy and profits, right from seed selection to trading. The proposed IANN technique produced a higher yield than the traditional method with a profit of 51%, 35% and 20% for rice, bananas and flowers, respectively. Similarly, the IANN technique provides 99.15% prediction accuracy in terms of a profit analysis. The blockchain and edge computing-based transactions improve security and reduce transactional latency. The proposed system ensures sustainability and traceability in agriculture. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company."

These deployments utilize hardware-based components for data sensing & actuation, while cloud components are used for data-processing & recommending control decisions. This process involves multiple low-security, low-computational capacity & high-performance entities like IoT Devices, short range communication interfaces, edge devices, routers, & cloud virtual machines. Out of these entities, the IoT Device, router, & short-range communication interfaces are highly vulnerable to a wide-variety of attacks including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), worm hole, sybil, Man in the Middle (MiTM), Masquerading, spoofing attacks, etc. To counter these attacks, a wide variety of encryption, key-exchange, and data modification models are proposed by researchers. Each of these models have their own levels of complexities, which reduces QoS of underlying IoT deployments. To overcome this limitation, blockchain-based security models were proposed by researchers, and these models allow for high-speed operations for small-scale networks. But as network size is increased, delay needed for blockchain mining increases exponentially, which limits its applicability. To overcome this issue, a machine learning based blockchain model for QoS-aware secure IoT deployments is proposed in this text. The proposed MLSMBQS model initially deploys a Proof-of-Work (PoW) based blockchain model, and then uses bioinspired computing to split the chain into multiple sub-chains. These sub-chains are termed as shards, and assists in reduction of mining delay via periodic chain splitting process. The significance of this research is use of Elephant Herd Optimization (EHO) which assists in managing number of blockchain-shards via splitting or merging them for different deployment conditions. This decision of splitting or merging depends on blockchain’s security & quality of service (QoS) performance. Due to integration of EHO for creation & management of sidechains, the findings of this research showcase that the proposed model is capable of improving throughput by 8.5%, reduce communication delay by 15.3%, reduce energy consumption by 4.9%, and enhance security performance by 14.8% when compared with existing blockchain & non-blockchain based security models. This is possible because EHO initiates dummy communication requests, which are arbitrarily segregated into malicious & non-malicious, and usedfor continuous QoS & security performance improvement of the proposed model. Due to this continuous performance improvement, the proposed MLSMBQS model is capable of deployment for a wide variety of high-efficiency IoT network scenarios. © 2022, Modern Education and Computer Science Press.

EHRs contain medical information such as demographics, laboratory test results, radiological images, vaccination status, insurance policy, and claims. EHR is essential for doctors and healthcare organizations to analyze a patient's profile and provide appropriate therapy. Despite this, current electronic health record (EHR) systems lag with difficulties such as Interoperability and security. Better and faster care may be provided with an integrated and secure health record for each patient that can be transmitted easily in real-time across countries. People having health insurance policies are often confronted by insurance jargon and the insurer’s cumbersome requirements while filing a claim for treatment. There are times when the claims processing takes longer than expected. The insurer, Third-Party Administrators (TPAs), and network provider hospitals examine, approve, and initiate the sum claimed. The use of blockchain in the process allows for more efficient information sharing at a lower cost and with more security. Only authorized individuals have access to the shared ledger on a blockchain, making it more confidential and secure. All parties engaged in a health insurance policy, including the insurer, the insured, the TPA, and the network provider hospital, may be members of the blockchain network and have access to the same set of policy data.

A standard data-sharing organization stage is important in the current data-sharing courses of action, and clients transmit their information to a cloud server for limitation and dispersion. Customers, on the other hand, would lose control of their data the instant it was sent off the server, making security and insurance a major worry. Even though data encryption and access control are regarded as cutting-edge innovations for storing individual data on cloud servers, they only go so far. Regardless, it continues to depend heavily on an external source of validity, the Cloud Service Provider (CSP). To tackle this challenge, they combined blockchain, 3DES ciphertext technology, ECC, and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). This research focuses on BTDEC, a Blockchain-based Trible Data Elliptic Curve Crypto System for Personal Data. The data holder encrypts the sharing data and saves it on IPFS in this customer-driven way, boosting the decentralization of the arrangement. The standardized data area and unscrambling key will be coupled utilizing 3DES with ECC, and the data owner will disseminate his data-related information and send on keys to data customers using blockchain, according to the built-up confirmation method. The data may only be downloaded and interpreted by the data client whose credits fulfill the confirmation conditions. BTDEC enables the data owner to deny a particular data client at the individual dimension without affecting others, providing him fine-grained network access over his data. When obtaining data, the ciphertext phrase search is almost usually utilized to secure the data customer's security.

First, we design the distributed protocols for achieving group consensus, in which the strengths of the interactions among the agents are enhanced through tuning the coupling strengths. Further, taking the difference of the edges among agents into account, edge-based distributed protocols through tuning coupling weights of a fraction of edges are designed. Remarkably, only the edges of spanning tree in each group are pinned and the coupling strengths or weights of pinned edges are enhanced according to the updated laws.

Recently, the concept of off-chain transactions is introduced that led to the idea of establishing a payment channel network called Lightning Network (LN), which utilizes multi-hop payments. Off-chain links provide the ability to make instant payments without a need to writing to Blockchain. However, LN's design still favors fees, and it is creating hub nodes or relays that defeat the purpose of Blockchain. In addition, it is still not reliable, as not all transactions are guaranteed to be delivered to their destinations. These issues hinder its wide adoption by retailers. To address this issue, in this paper, we argue that the retailers could create a private payment channel network among them to serve their business needs, just like the concept of private Blockchains. The goal is to build a pure peer-to-peer topology that will prevent the formation of hub nodes while also eliminating the need for any relays to increase the robustness of the payments. Assuming off-chain links as edges and retailers as nodes, we formulate the problem as a multi-flow commodity problem where transactions represent the commodities from various sources to destinations. As the multi-flow commodity problem is NP-Complete, we propose a heuristic approach that utilizes Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for payments in a dynamic way by updating the edge weights when new paths need to be found. The order of transactions is randomized to provide fairness among the retailers. We further extend this approach to guarantee the privacy of payments by forcing all the payments to travel at least three hops. We utilized k-shortest path algorithm to choose from k options that will meet our criterion. The evaluations indicate that the proposed heuristic comes close to an optimal solution while providing scalability and guaranteeing user privacy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

In this context, the IoT tsunami, the ubiquitous adoption of intelligent connected devices, and the public embracement of DLT, of which blockchain is a popular example, are increasingly becoming an integral feature of many modern systems, particularly, IoT-based smart and connected healthcare. Although the IoT and DLT/blockchain are two very different technologies and distinct from each other, the fusion of blockchain and IoT technologies is an unprecedented paradigm shift that is expected to disrupt both current and future systems in various fields. Blockchain has exactly what is needed to fix the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of IoT. It solves the security fault line among intelligent IoT where most of the IoT devices are connected to each other through the public trustless environment. Moreover, its distributed peer-to-peer nature can address the shortcomings of client/server models in Cloud-IoT solutions. Although the convergence of IoT and blockchain (Blockchain-IoT) can potentially tackle major shortcomings of today's solutions, its adoption is still in infancy, suffering from various issues and thus there is a necessity to address significant challenges including scalability, consensus algorithms, data privacy, efficiency, availability, storage, interoperability, and standardization, among others. In addition, there is no consensus towards any reference model or best practices that specify how blockchain should be utilized in IoT.

Since mining pools are bounded rational in practice, we model the dynamic interactions among them by an evolutionary game in Stage II, in which each pool pursues its evolutionary stable demand based on the observed price, through continuous learning and adjustments. Backward induction method is applied to analyze the sub-game equilibrium in each stage. Specifically in Stage II, we first build a general study framework for the evolutionary game model, and then provide a detailed theoretical analysis for a two-pool case to characterize the conditions for the existence of different evolutionary stable solutions. Referring to the real world, we conduct a series of numerical experiments, whose results validate our theoretical findings for the case of two mining pools.

However, there is no consensus on EOA measurement of self-expanding THV. We aimed to compare two echocardiographic methods for EOA measurement following transcatheter self-expanding aortic valve implantation. Methods EOA was calculated according to the continuity equation. Two methods were constructed. In Method 1 and Method 2, the left ventricular outflow tract diameter (LVOTd) was measured at the entry of the prosthesis (from trailing-to-leading edge) and proximal to the prosthetic valve leaflets (from trailing-to-leading edge), respectively. The velocity-time integral (VTI) of the LVOT (VTILVOT) was recorded by pulsed-wave Doppler (PW) from apical windows. The region of the PW sampling should match that of the LVOTd measurement with precise localization. The mean transvalvular pressure gradient (MG) and VTI of THV was measured by Continuous wave Doppler. Results A total of 113 consecutive patients were recruited. The mean age was 77.2 ± 5.5 years, and 72 patients (63.7%) were male. EOA1 with the use of Method 1 was larger than EOA2 (1.56 ± 0.39 cm2 vs. 1.48 ± 0.41 cm2, P = 0.001). MG correlated better with the indexed EOA1 (EOAI1) (r = -0.701, P &lt; 0.001) than EOAI2 (r = -0.645, P &lt; 0.001). According to EOAI (EOAI ≤ 0.65 cm2/m2, respectively), the proportion of sever prosthesis-patient mismatch with the use of EOA1 was lower than EOA2 (12.4% vs. 21.2%, P &lt; 0.05). Compared with EOA2, EOA1 had lower interobserver and intra-observer variability (intra: 0.5% ± 17% vs. 3.8% ± 22%, P &lt; 0.001; inter: 1.0% ± 9% vs. 3.5% ± 11%, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions For transcatheter self-expanding valve EOA measurement, LVOTd should be measured in the entry of the prosthesis stent (from trailing-to-leading edge), and VTILVOT should match that of the LVOTd measurement with precise localization. © 2020 JGC All rights reserved; www.jgc301.com"

Therefore, it is very important to identify essential proteins from a large number of other proteins. Due to the time-consuming, expensive, and inefficient process in biological experimental methods, computational methods become more and more popular to recognize them. In the early stages, these methods mainly rely on protein-protein interaction (PPI) information, which limits their discovery capacities. Researchers find novel methods by fusing multi-information to improve prediction accuracy. According to these features, essential proteins are more important and conservative in the evolution process, their neighbors in PPI networks are usually likely to be essential, there are many false positives in PPI data, whether a protein is essential can be assessed by the importance of a protein itself, the relevance of neighbors and the reliability of PPIs. The importance of neighbors and the reliability of PPIs can be further integrated into neighborhood feature. In the study, orthologous information, edge-clustering coefficient and gene expression information are used to measure the importance of a protein itself, the importance of the neighbors and the reliability of PPIs, respectively.

Also, the framework provides efficient encryption of sensor data using the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm. Finally, key agreement processes in the framework were analyzed and results show that key pairing between the blockchain client and the edge node is a non-trivial process. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited."

In vehicles' environment, cognitive radio technology with mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) enables vehicles to monitor the available channels and to effectively function in these frequencies through sharing ongoing information with drivers and different frameworks to enhance traffic safety on roads. To fulfill the computational storage resources' limitations of a specific vehicle, Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) is used by merging VANET with cloud computing. Cloud computing requires high security and protection because authenticate users and attackers have the same rights in VCC. The security is enhanced in CRVANETs, but the distributed nature of cloud unlocks a door for dissimilar attacks, such as trust modal, data security, connection fault and query tracking attacks.

Various mechanisms for detecting security attacks that rely on centralized and distributed architectures have already been proposed, but they tend to be inefficient due to such problems as storage constraints, the high cost of computation, high latency, and a single point of failure. Moreover, existing security mechanisms are faced with the issue of monitoring and collecting historic data throughout the entire IoT network of the smart city in order to deliver optimal security and defense against cyberattacks. To address the current challenges, this paper proposes a decentralized security architecture based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) coupled with a blockchain technology for IoT network in the smart city that relies on the three core technologies of SDN, Blockchain, and Fog and mobile edge computing in order to detect attacks in the IoT network more effectively. Thus, in the proposed architecture, SDN is liable to continuous monitoring and analysis of traffic data in the entire IoT network in order to provide an optimal attack detection model; Blockchain delivers decentralized attack detection to mitigate the “single point of failure” problem inherent to the existing architecture; and Fog and mobile edge computing supports attack detection at the fog node and, subsequently, attack mitigation at the edge node, thus enabling early detection and mitigation with lesser storage constraints, cheaper computation, and low latency. To validate the performance of the proposed architecture, it was subjected to an experimental evaluation, the results of which show that it outperforms both centralized and distributed architectures in terms of accuracy and detection time. © 2019"

There are long-standing challenges in IoT, such as security, comparability, energy consumption, and heterogeneity of devices. Security and energy aspects play important roles in data transmission across IoT and edge networks, due to limited energy and computing (e.g., processing and storage) resources of networked devices. Whether malicious or accidental, interference with data in an IoT network potentially has real-world consequences. In this article, we explore the potential of integrating blockchain and software-defined networking (SDN) in mitigating some of the challenges. Specifically, we propose a secure and energy-efficient blockchain-enabled architecture of SDN controllers for IoT networks using a cluster structure with a new routing protocol. The architecture uses public and private blockchains for Peer to Peer (P2P) communication between IoT devices and SDN controllers, which eliminates Proof-of-Work (POW), as well as using an efficient authentication method with the distributed trust, making the blockchain suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices. The experimental results indicate that the routing protocol based on the cluster structure has higher throughput, lower delay, and lower energy consumption than EESCFD, SMSN, AODV, AOMDV, and DSDV routing protocols. In other words, our proposed architecture is demonstrated to outperform classic blockchain."

Here, we have considered blockchain as intermediary trusted agent to witness communication between a vehicle node and edge node, where edge node also uploads microservices along with calling figure of microservices to the blockchain. Furthermore, to ensure vehicle privacy with joint verification of vehicular network and server, we have devised a mechanism in which every vehicle nodes anonymously ask for services from the edge server along with signing an individual's identity. Moreover, based on generated vehicle requests and service awareness, we devised an improved edge cache scheme for the prior compilation of services at each edge.

Online mapping is one of the fundamental services offered in smart cities which enables the vehicle owners to find shortest or fastest direction toward a destination thus reduces travel cost and air pollution. However, existing online mapping services rely on centralized servers, e.g., Google, which collect data from users to offer service. This method is unlikely to scale with growth in the smart city participants and introduces privacy concerns and data wall where data of the users is managed by big companies. To address these challenges, in this paper we introduce DMap, a blockchain-based platform where the users can share data in an anonymous distributed manner with service providers. To the best of our knowledge, DMap is the first distributed blockchain-based solution for online mapping. To improve the scalability of the blockchain, we propose to use edge-computing along with blockchain. To protect against malicious vehicles that may inject false data, we define a reputation system where the collected data of the vehicles is verified by monitoring the neighbor data.

In smart grid, IoT devices generate huge amounts of data, which are collected and shared among DERs, microgrids, and the main grid. To protect the shared data, it is necessary to implement the secure and efficient data access control. Ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a promising solution for the distributed system. However, lightweight IoT devices with limited computing capability cannot handle the computationally intensive ABE algorithms. To overcome this constraint, the decryption phase of CP-ABE is usually outsourced to the cloud, but this is inefficient and not safe enough in the distributed environment. In this article, we propose an edge blockchain empowered secure data access control scheme with fair accountability for the smart grid. The computation workloads of end user devices are outsourced to the edge nodes in a consortium blockchain system We adopt an on-chain/off-chain approach to ensure the flexible data sharing. Additionally, we adopt the threshold secret sharing scheme to establish a distributed authority.

On the Internet, this part of our identity is in the hands of others. People rely on a variety of VoIP/chat/instant messaging and other applications to socialize, inform and collaborate with others. To use these centralized services, users must either hand over their full list of associations or have their associations tracked over time by the centralized service. This results in lack of user privacy, lock-in of users who cannot easily switch to another service, and a general stifling of application innovation. In this paper, we propose decoupling such applications from the list of associations. We present the Decentralized Connectivity Service (DCS), a privacy-preserving blockchain-based connectivity service for distributed social communication applications. DCS puts control of a user's interactions with others, back in the hands of the user and allows users to establish point-to-point connections with other users, without the use of a centralized party. DCS consists of a set of DHT nodes and a local Contact Management Service that resides on the user's local device that, together, facilitate social communication applications running on edge devices to establish connectivity. A user's associations (i.e., contacts/friends-list) never leave the user's personal device without user permission and thus, remain under the user's control.

Routers generally trust the veracity of information in BGP updates from their neighbors, as with many other routing protocols. However, this trust leaves the whole system vulnerable to multiple attacks, such as BGP hijacking. Several solutions have been proposed to increase the security of BGP routing protocol, most based on centralized Public Key Infrastructure, but their adoption has been relatively slow. Additionally, these solutions are open to attack on this centralized system. Decentralized alternatives utilizing blockchain to validate BGP updates have recently been proposed. The distributed nature of blockchain and its trustless environment increase the overall system security and conform to the distributed character of the BGP. All of the techniques based on blockchain concentrate on inspecting incoming BGP updates only. In this paper, we improve on these by modifying an existing architecture for the management of network devices. The original architecture adopted a private blockchain implementation of HyperLedger. On the other hand, we use the public blockchain Ethereum, more specifically the Ropsten testing environment. Our solution provides a module design for the management of AS border routers. It enables verification of the prefixes even before any router sends BGP updates announcing them. Thus, we eliminate fraudulent BGP origin announcements from the AS deploying our solution. Furthermore, blockchain provides storage options for configurations of edge routers and keeps the irrefutable history of all changes. We can analyze router settings history to detect whether the router advertised incorrect information, when and for how long."

In this paper, we will review the research on distributed systems in the last few years to identify the limits of open peer-to-peer networks. We will address issues like system complexity, security and frailty, instability and performance. We will show how many of the aforementioned problems also apply to the recent breed of permissionless blockchain networks. The applicability of such systems to mature industrial applications is undermined by the same properties that make them so interesting for a libertarian audience: namely, their openness, their pseudo-anonymity and their unregulated cryptocurrencies. As such, we argue that permissionless blockchain networks are unsuitable to be the substrate for a decentralized Internet. Yet, there is still hope for more decentralization, albeit in a form somewhat limited with respect to the libertarian view of decentralized Internet: in cooperation rather than in competition with the superpowerful datacenters that dominate the world today. This is derived from the recent surge in interest in byzantine fault tolerance and permissioned blockchains, which opens the door to a world where use of trusted third parties is not the only way to arbitrate an ensemble of entities. The ability of establish trust through permissioned blockchains enables to move the control from the datacenters to the edge, truly realizing the promises of edge-centric computing."

A directed random graph is used to model the time-varying availability of the target states to agents, where the connection of the directed edge in the graph is assumed to be probabilistic and evolves according to a two-state Markov Model. An almost sure consensus algorithm is developed for all agents to achieve consensus on the target position. Due to limited communication capabilities (i.e.. the agents can only communicate within a certain range), agent motion may result in a disconnected communication network, leading to the failure of consensus to the target states. Motivated to preserve the graph connectivity of the position-dependent communication network, an algebraic-connectivity-based distributed motion controller is developed to ensure that the communication network remains connected during cooperative target tracking. Compared to existing results, our approach allows agents to break existing links when necessary as long as the algebraic connectivity remains positive, which provides more motion freedom for agents in mission operation. Moreover, our approach only requires information exchange within two-hop neighbors to preserve the network connectivity, which eliminates the need of iterative estimation of the algebraic connectivity."

A class of minibatch stochastic alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) algorithms is explored to develop the distributed learning model.

Given an appropriate minibatch size, we show that the minibatch stochastic ADMM-based method converges in a rate of O(1/root k), where k denotes the number of iterations. Through numerical experiments, it is revealed that the proposed algorithm is communication efficient, rapidly responding, and robust in the presence of straggler nodes compared with state-of-the-art algorithms."

We show that the network is unstable if either the negative weight edges form a cut in the graph or any single negative edge weight has a magnitude less than the inverse of the effective resistance between the two incident nodes. These results are then used to analyze the robustness of the consensus network with additive but bounded perturbations of the edge weights. It is shown that the small-gain condition is related again to cuts in the graph and effective resistance. For the single edge case, the small-gain condition is also shown to be exact. The results are then extended to consensus networks with nonlinear couplings."

Demand Response (DR) has been identified as a key enabler of integrating these, and other, Smart Grid technologies, while, simultaneously, ensuring grid stability and secure energy supply. The massive deployment of smart meters, IoT devices and DERs dictate the need to move to decentralized, or even localized, DR schemes in the face of the increased scale and complexity of monitoring and coordinating the actors and devices in modern smart grids. Furthermore, there is an inherent need to guarantee interoperability, due to the vast number of, e.g., hardware and software stakeholders, and, more importantly, promote trust and incentivize the participation of customers in DR schemes, if they are to be successfully deployed. In this work, we illustrate the design of an energy system that addresses all of the roadblocks that hinder the large scale deployment of DR services. Our DR framework incorporates modern Smart Grid technologies, such as fog-enabled and IoT devices, DERs and RES to, among others, automate asset handling and various time-consuming workilows. To guarantee interoperability, our system employs OpenADR, which standardizes the communication of DR signals among energy stakeholders. Our approach acknowledges the need for decentralization and employs blockchains and smart contracts to deliver a secure, privacy-preserving, tamper-resistant, auditable and reliable DR framework. Blockchains provide the infrastructure to design innovative DR schemes and incentivize active consumer participation as their aforementioned properties promote transparency and trust. In addition, we harness the power of smart contracts which allows us to design and implement fully automated contractual agreements both among involved stakeholders, as well as on a machine-to-machine basis. Smart contracts are digital agents that live in the blockchain and can encode, execute and enforce arbitrary agreements. To illustrate the potential and effectiveness of our smart contract-based DR framework, we present a case study that describes the exchange of DR signals and the autonomous instantiation of smart contracts among involved participants to mediate and monitor transactions, enforce contractual clauses, regulate energy supply and handle payments/penalties."

The value proposition of IoT is the connection to the Internet of a myriad of devices that provide and exchange data to improve people's lives and add value to industries. The blockchain technology transfers data and value in an immutable and decentralised fashion. Security, composed of both non-intentional and intentional risk management, is a fundamental design requirement for both IoT and blockchain. We study how blockchain answers some of the IoT security requirements with a focus on intentional risk. The review of a sample of security incidents impacting public blockchains confirm that identity and access management (IAM) is a key security requirement to build resilience against intentional risk. This fact is also applicable to IoT solutions built on a blockchain. We compare the two IoT platforms based on public permissionless distributed ledgers with the highest market capitalisation: IOTA, run on an alternative to a blockchain, which is a directed acyclic graph (DAG); and IoTeX, its contender, built on a blockchain. Our objective is to discover how we can create IAM resilience against intentional risk in these IoT platforms. For that, we turn to complex network theory: a tool to describe and compare systems with many participants. We conclude that IoTeX and possibly IOTA transaction networks are scale-free. As both platforms are vulnerable to attacks, they require resilience against intentional risk. In the case of IoTeX, DIoTA provides a resilient IAM solution. Furthermore, we suggest that resilience against intentional risk requires an IAM concept that transcends a single blockchain. Only with the interplay of edge and global ledgers can we obtain data integrity in a multi-vendor and multi-purpose IoT network."

Nodes in the network take spatial samples of the random field, then each node estimates the values of arbitrary points on the random field by iteratively exchanging information with each other. The objective is to minimize the estimation mean squared error (MSE) while ensuring all nodes reach a distributed consensus on the estimation results. We propose a distributed iterative linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) algorithm that contains a state consensus stage and a local estimation stage in each iteration. The proposed algorithm requires the knowledge of the second-order statistics of the random field, and they are estimated by using a distributed learning algorithm with the help of distributed consensus. The key parameters of the algorithm, including an edge weight matrix and a sample weight matrix, are designed to minimize an MSE upper bound at all nodes when the number of iterations is large. It is shown that the optimum performance can be achieved by distributively mapping the high dimension measurement samples from all nodes into a low dimension subspace related to the covariance matrices of data and noise samples. The low-dimension mapping is achieved in a distributed manner through iterative information propagation. The low dimension mapping can significantly reduce the amount of data exchanged in the network, thus improve the convergence speed of the iterative algorithm."

Since an analytical calculation of settling time for time delay systems is extremely difficult, if not impossible, and since rightmost roots only provide a rough estimation of state decay rate, here we take a statistical approach and analyze numerous case studies through time-domain simulations of the consensus system impulse response. On benchmark problems, we show that the graph underlying the consensus network together with the ratio tau/tau* and agents' initial conditions determine reaching consensus faster/slower. Specifically, we report that (i) for relatively large delays with tau < tau*, there is a set of graphs obtained by removing some edges between the agents with which fast consensus can be achieved, by about an order of magnitude reduction in settling time, and (ii) removing from a fully connected graph the edge corresponding to the largest difference of initial state values will reduce the settling time in the presence of large time delay."

We investigate how robust consensus (small steady state variance of the states) can be achieved within a linear time-invariant setting by optimally assigning edges to state-dimensions. We show that a finite steady state variance of the states can be achieved if and only if the minimum cut capacity of the network is not smaller than the dimensionality of the state vectors.

However, applying blockchain principles in the IoT is a challenge due to the constraints of the end devices. Because of fierce cost pressure, the hardware resources in these devices are usually reduced to the minimum necessary for operation. To achieve the high coverage needed, low bitrate mobile or wireless technologies are frequently applied, so the communication is often constrained, too. These constraints make the implementation of blockchain nodes for IoT as standalone end-devices impractical or even impossible. We therefore investigated possible design approaches to decentralized applications based on the Ethereum blockchain for the IoT. We proposed and evaluated three application architectures differing in communication, computation, storage, and security requirements. In a pilot setup we measured and analyzed the data traffic needed to run the blockchain clients and their applications. We found out that with the appropriate designs and the remote server architecture we can strongly reduce the storage and communication requirements imposed on devices, with predictable security implications. Periodic device traffic is reduced to 2400 B/s (HTTP) and 170 B/s (Websocket) from about 18 kB/s in the standalone-device full client architecture. A notification about a captured blockchain event and the corresponding verification resulted in about 2000 B of data. A transaction sent from the application to the client resulted in an about 500 B (HTTP) and 300 B message (Websocket). The key store location, which affects the serialization of a transaction, only had a small influence on the transaction-related data. Raw transaction messages were 45 B larger than when passing the JSON transaction objects. These findings provide directions for fog/cloud IoT application designers to avoid unrealistic expectations imposed upon their IoT devices and blockchain technologies, and enable them to select the appropriate system design according to the intended use case and system constraints. However, for very low bit-rate communication networks, new communication protocols for device to blockchain-client need to be considered."

By introducing the concepts of risk management and blockchain into the trust mechanism, we here propose a blockchain-based trust mechanism for distributed IoT devices in this paper. In the proposed trust mechanism, trustrank is quantified by normative trust and risk measures, and a new storage structure is designed for the domain administration manager to identify and delete the malicious evaluations of the devices. Evidence shows that the proposed trust mechanism can ensure data sharing and integrity, in addition to its resistance against malicious attacks to the IoT devices."

Like many areas of the information technology domain, IoT sensors are also prone to attacks but on a larger scale. There are millions of devices being connected to a central domain to provide different types of services. Since these low-powered IoT devices have constrained technical requirements with less computational capabilities, they lack the capacity to judge their behavior as benign or malignant. IoT relies heavily on the higher level of intelligent nodes to decide on their status. An IoT Controller/Edge server handles the registration and the limited management of devices. Since traditional security is unable to protect the IoT environment sufficiently, we present a Blockchain-based DDoS detection approach to secure and mitigate such attacks in the IoT environment. Our test setup includes dataset from four sensors over two months. These values were tested using a threshold calculation against the variation of temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind direction on that day to find out whether an IoT sensor is under a DDoS attack. Our results show how DOTS can help in detection of attack when mapped on IoT edge computing."

Centralized approaches have been used to build federated trust among platforms and devices, but limit diversity and scalability. We propose a decentralized trust framework, called IoT Passport, for cross-platform collaborations using blockchain technology. IoT Passport is motivated by the familiar use of passports for international travel but with greater dynamism. It enables platforms to establish arbitrary trust relations with each other containing specific rules for intended collaborations, enforced by a combination of smart contracts. Each interaction among devices is signed by the participants and recorded on the blockchain. The records are utilized as attributes for authorization and as proofs of incentive plans.

Recently, the concept of off-chain payments is introduced that led to the idea of establishing a payment network called Lightning Network (LN). Off-chain links provide the ability to do transactions without writing to Blockchain. However, LN's design still favors fees and is creating hub nodes that defeat the purpose of Blockchain. In addition, it is still not reliable as not all the transactions are guaranteed to be transmitted to their destinations. If current retailers would like to use it, these problems might hinder its adoption. To address this issue, in this paper, we advocate creating a private payment network among a given set of retailers that will serve their business needs, just like the idea of private Blockchains. The goal is to build a pure peer-to-peer topology that will eliminate the need for relays and increase the robustness of payments. Using off-chain links as edges and retailers as nodes, the problem is formulated as a multi-flow commodity problem where transactions represent the commodities from various sources to destinations. As the multi-flow commodity problem is NY-Complete, we propose a heuristic approach that utilizes Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in a dynamic way by updating the edge weights when new payment paths are to be found. The order of transactions is randomized to provide fairness among the retailers. The evaluations indicate that the proposed heuristic comes close to an optimal solution while providing scalability and user privacy."

Among various PQC schemes, lattice-based cryptography (LBC) based on learning with error (LWE) has attracted much attention because of its performance efficiency and security guarantee. In LWE-based LBCs, the Module-LWE-based schemes gain advantage over the others benefiting from the unique polynomial matrix and vector structure. To provide a high-performance implementation of Module-LWE applications for the edge computing paradigm, we propose a domain-specific processor based on a matrix extension of RISC-V architecture. This custom extension encapsulates the matrix-based ring operations with a high-level functional abstraction. A 2-D systolic array with configurable functionality is proposed to perform matrix-based number theoretic transform (NTT) and other arithmetic operations, achieving high data-level parallelism with support for the variable-sized polynomial matrix and vector structure. As this structure of Module-LWE involves no data dependency between different inner elements, an out-of-order mechanism is further developed to exploit the instruction-level parallelism. We implement the proposed architecture under TSMC 28nm technology.

Therefore, this paper proposes a blockchain-based authentication and dynamic group key agreement protocol. With our protocol, each group member only needs to authenticate its left neighbor once to complete the authentication, which improved authentication efficiency. In addition, our protocol guarantees the forward secrecy of group members after joining the group and the backward secrecy of group members after leaving the group.

Many recent studies propose that edge nodes use blockchain for the decentralized management and access control of IoT data. However, due to the massive volume of data and related transactions, edge servers will eventually run out of space to store the full chain. We introduce scalable and lightweight architecture called LiTiChain, a blockchain of blocks with finite lifetime. In LiTiChain, outdated transactions and blocks, that is, the blocks whose lifetimes are expired, can be safely removed from the chain. Two graphs are merged into the structure of LiTiChain: 1) a tree representing the order of expiry of lifetimes and 2) a linear graph representing the order of block creation. We show that this construction not only ensures the connectivity of the chain after block deletions but also helps to maintain the block height of shortened chain. LiTiChain also supports transactions whose lifetime is unknown at the time of creation. It is possible that some expired blocks need to be retained in the chain, in case they are needed to validate remaining blocks, which incurs additional storage costs. A detailed analysis of such overhead in storage costs is presented for stochastic and worst case scenarios. Extensive simulation is performed on actual and synthetic IoT data so as to gain insights on the storage costs under various lifetime distributions. It is demonstrated that LiTiChain provides a simple yet effective solution to scalability problems in storing blockchains for the IoT ecosystems."

Materials and Methods: 3T MRI data acquired with T-1-weighted gradient-echo black-blood imaging sequence from carotid (39 subjects) and aorta (39 subjects) were used to develop and test the algorithm. The vessel wall segmentation was achieved by respectively fitting a 3D cylindrical B-spline surface to the boundaries of lumen and outer wall. The tube-fitting was based on the edge detection performed on the signal intensity (SI) profile along the surface normal. To achieve a fully automated process, Hough Transform (HT) was developed to estimate the lumen centerline and radii for the target vessel. Using the outputs of HT, a tube model for lumen segmentation was initialized and deformed to fit the image data. Finally, lumen segmentation was dilated to initiate the adaptation procedure of outer wall tube. The algorithm was validated by determining: 1) its performance against manual tracing; 2) its interscan reproducibility in quantifying vessel wall thickness (VWT); 3) its capability of detecting VWT difference in hypertensive patients compared with healthy controls. Statistical analysis including Bland-Altman analysis, t-test, and sample size calculation were performed for the purpose of algorithm evaluation. Results: The mean distance between the manual and automatically detected lumen/outer wall contours was 0.00 +/- 0.23/0.09 +/- 0.21 mm for CCA and 0.12 +/- 0.24/0.14 +/- 0.35 mm for DAO. No significant difference was observed between the interscan VWT assessment using automated segmentation for both CCA (P = 0.19) and DAO (P = 0.94). Both manual and automated segmentation detected significantly higher carotid (P = 0.016 and P = 0.005) and aortic (P < 0.001 and P = 0.021) wall thickness in the hypertensive patients. Conclusion: A reliable and reproducible pipeline for fully automatic vessel wall quantification was developed and validated on healthy volunteers as well as patients with increased vessel wall thickness.

Also, the learning process is often difficult to automate. A unified analytical framework for trusted machine learning has been presented in the literature to address both issues. It is proposed building a trusted machine learning system by using blockchain technology, which can store data in a permanent and immutable way. In addition, smart contracts on blockchain are used to automate the machine learning process. However, in such a blockchain framework, data efficiency is a big concern, because it is very expensive to store a large amount of data on blockchain. On the other hand, machine learning based computer vision systems often rely on a lot of data. Therefore, to fully leverage a blockchain-based machine learning framework for computer vision systems, data efficiency issues must be addressed. This paper investigates how to enhance data efficiency in such a framework to bring computer vision systems to the edge. It presents a three-step approach. First, a lightweight machine learning model is trained on the server layer. Second, the trained model is saved in a special binary data format for data efficiency. Finally, the streaming layer takes these binary data as input and scores incoming new data in an online fashion. Real-time semantic segmentation for autonomous driving is used as an example to demonstrate how this approach works. This paper makes the following contributions. First, it improves the analytical framework for trusted computer vision systems based on blockchain. Second, the real-time semantic segmentation example shows how data-efficient learning for computer vision can be performed on the edge."

The Path Consistency (PC) algorithm is one of the popular methods in this field. However, as an order dependent algorithm, PC algorithm is not robust because it achieves different network topologies if gene orders are permuted. In addition, the performance of this algorithm depends on the threshold value used for independence tests. Consequently, selecting suitable sequential ordering of nodes and an appropriate threshold value for the inputs of PC algorithm are challenges to infer a good GRN. In this work, we propose a heuristic algorithm, namely SORDER, to find a suitable sequential ordering of nodes. Based on the SORDER algorithm and a suitable interval threshold for Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) tests, a network inference method, namely the Consensus Network (CN), has been developed. In the proposed method, for each edge of the complete graph, a weighted value is defined. This value is considered as the reliability value of dependency between two nodes. The final inferred network, obtained using the CN algorithm, contains edges with a reliability value of dependency of more than a defined threshold. The effectiveness of this method is benchmarked through several networks from the DREAM challenge and the widely used SOS DNA repair network in Escherichia coli.

Tracking of network modules in time-varying brain functional networks is not yet commonly considered in neuroscience despite its potential for gaining an understanding of the time evolution of functional interaction patterns and associated changing degrees of functional segregation and integration. We introduce a general computational framework for extracting consensus partitions from defined time windows in sequences of weighted directed edge-complete networks and show how the temporal reorganization of the module structure can be tracked and visualized. Part of the framework is a new approach for computing edge weight thresholds for individual networks based on multiobjective optimization of module structure quality criteria as well as an approach for matching modules across time steps. By testing our framework using synthetic network sequences and applying it to brain functional networks computed from electroencephalographic recordings of healthy subjects that were exposed to a major balance perturbation, we demonstrate the framework's potential for gaining meaningful insights into dynamic brain function in the form of evolving network modules. The precise chronology of the neural processing inferred with our framework and its interpretation helps to improve the currently incomplete understanding of the cortical contribution for the compensation of such balance perturbations."

A network is composed by nodes and edges. Edges serve as the connection between nodes to exchange state information and further achieve state consensus. Through edges, the dynamics of individual nodes at the local level intimately affects the network dynamics at the global level. As a following bird can occasionally lose visual contact with the target bird in a flock at any moment, the edge between two nodes in a real world network systems is not necessarily always intact. Contrary to common sense, these real-world networks are usually perfectly stable even when the edges between the nodes are unstable. This suggests that not only nodes are dynamical, edges are dynamical, too. Since the edges between the nodes are changing dynamically, network configuration is also dynamical. Further, edges need be defined and quantified so that the unstable connection behavior can be properly described. The paper explores the concepts of statistical mechanics and statistical entropy to address the particular need Statistical mechanics describes the behavior of a mechanical system that has uncertain states. Statistical entropy on the other hand defines the distribution of the microstates by probability. Entropy provides a measure of the level of network integrity. With entropy, one can assign desired dynamics to the network to ensure desired network property. This work aims to construct a complex network structure model based on the edge dynamics. Coupled with node self-dynamic and consensus law, a general dynamical network model can be constructed."

As with other consequences of the MSS theorem, it is not clear how one would explicitly construct such a subgraph. We show that such a subgraph (although with quantitatively weaker expansion and near-regularity properties than those predicted by MSS) can be constructed with high probability in linear time, via a simple algorithm. Our algorithm allows a distributed implementation that runs in O(log n) rounds and does O(n) total work with high probability. The analysis of the algorithm is complicated by the complex dependencies that arise between edges and between choices made in different rounds. We sidestep these difficulties by following the combinatorial approach of counting the number of possible random choices of the algorithm which lead to failure. We do so by a compression argument showing that such random choices can be encoded with a non-trivial compression. Our algorithm bears some similarity to the way agents construct a communication graph in a peer-to-peer network, and, in the bipartite case, to the way agents select servers in blockchain protocols."

Various results have been developed to enable multiagent systems to complete desired tasks in finite-time. However, most existing results in the literature can only ensure finite-time consensus without considering temporal constraints, where the time used to achieve consensus cannot be preset arbitrarily and is generally determined by the system initial conditions, prohibiting its application in time-sensitive tasks. Motivated to achieve consensus within a desired time frame, user-specified finite-time consensus is developed in the present work for a multiagent system to ensure consensus at a prespecified time instant. The interaction among agents (e.g., communication and information exchange) is modeled as a time-varying graph, where each edge is associated with a time-varying weight representing the time-varying interaction between neighboring agents. Consensus over such time-varying graph is then proven based on a time transformation and is guaranteed to be completed within a prespecified time frame. To demonstrate the developed framework, finite-time rendezvous of a multiagent system is considered as an example application, where agents with limited communication capabilities are desired to meet at a common location at a preset time instant with constraints on preserving global network connectivity. A numerical simulation is provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the developed result."

Internet of things (IoT) comes with a solution to manage a complex, scalable supply chain system, but to provide and attain enough security during information exchange, along with keeping the privacy of its users, is the great inherent challenge of IoT. To fulfill these limitations, this study designs and models a scaled IoT-based supply chain (IoT-SC) system, comprising several operations and participants, and deploys mechanisms to leverage the security, mainly confidentially, integrity, authentication (CIA), and a digital signature scheme to leverage potentially secured non-repudiation security service for the worst-case scenario, and to leverage privacy to keep users sensitive personal and location information protected against adversarial entities to the IoT-SC system. Indeed, a scaled IoT-SC system certainly opens new challenges to manage privacy and security while communicating. Therefore, in the IoT-SC system, each transaction writes from edge computing nodes to the IoT-SC controller is thoroughly examined to ensure the proposed solutions in bi-directional communication, and their robustness against adversarial behaviors.

Specifically, the adaptive coupling weights and the saturation functions are embedded into the proposed protocols, and the former can render the protocols independent of any global topology graph information, while the latter can confine the relative state to stay in its constrained set. Sufficient conditions are identified under which the constrained consensus can be achieved.

The asynchronous property lies in the edge event-detecting procedure. For different edges, their event detections are performed at different times and the corresponding events occur independently of each other. When an event is activated, the two adjacent agents connected by the corresponding link sample their relative state information and update their controllers. The application of incidence matrix facilitates the transformation of control objects from the agent-based to the edge-based. Practically, due to the constraints of network bandwidth and communication distance, agents usually cannot receive the instantaneous information of some others, which has an impact on the system performance. Hence, it is necessary to investigate the presence of communication time delays. For double-integrator multiagent systems with and without communication time delays, the average state consensus can be asynchronously achieved by designing appropriate parameters under the proposed event-detecting rules. The presented results specify the relationship among the maximum allowable time delays, interaction topologies, and event-detecting periods. Furthermore, the proposed protocols have the advantages of reduced communication costs and controller-updating costs. Simulation examples are given to illustrate the proposed theoretical results."

This paper presents a distributed mechanism for mobile data offloading in software defined network (SDN) at the network edge. In SON, the data traffic of base stations (BSs) can be dynamically offloaded to access points (APs), which is enabled by the SDN controller. The SON controller formulates a revenue maximization problem to optimize the data offloading decision, and solves the problem in a fully distributed fashion. The proposed mechanism is based on the proximal Jacobian multi-block alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). BSs and APs perform the offloading decision update concurrently, and are coordinated by the SON controller through dual variables to reach a consensus on the offloading demand and supply. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

These are not unaccustomed words anymore in our lives. Although the technologies are in the infancy step and are still many remaining technical challenges, there is no doubt that it will be one of the major parts of the future Internet. The efficiency and security of data transmission scheme have always been major issues in the legacy Internet, and a data transmission scheme for the future Internet, including 5G and IoT environment should also provide and support these issues. Consequently, we propose a new data transmission scheme to successfully support the future Internet environment. The proposed scheme, which is named as S-DTS (Secure Data Transmission Scheme), supports a distributed transmission and decentralized access control. The S-DTS utilizes 4 synchronization zones, which are IoT network zone, aggregation zone, mining zone, and management zone, and these zones are operated by the DPN (Delegated Proof of Node) mechanism. Furthermore, all nodes are categorized to the 3 node groups, LDTG (Low Delay Tolerance Group), MDTG (Medium Delay Tolerance Group), HDTG (High Delay Tolerance Group), to provide an efficient data transmission, and the data in each group will be transmitted in accordance with their own traffic attributes. The evaluation results of this scheme show that it is very suitable for massive IoT environment scenarios, and IoT devices can take advantage of safe and efficient transmission by using the delegated proof of node technique. In addition, the S-DTS might be adaptable for various computing and networking environment with big data, edge cloud and cloud computing, and autonomous networking."

The entire human race of all countries and regions has suffered devastating losses. With its high infectiousness and mortality rate, it is of great significance to carry out effective precautions and prevention of COVID-19. Specifically, the transportation system has been confirmed as one of the crucial spreading routes. Hence, enhancing healthcare monitoring and infection tracking for high-mobility transportation system is infeasible for pandemic control. Meanwhile, due to the promising advantages in the emerging intelligent transportation system (ITS), vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is able to collect and process relevant vehicular data for improving the driving experience and road safety, which provide a way for non-contact automatic healthcare monitoring. Furthermore, the proliferating cloud computing and blockchain techniques enable sufficient processing and storing capabilities, along with decentralized remote auditing towards heterogenous vehicular data. In this case, the automated infection tracking for pandemic control could be achieved accordingly. For the above consideration, in this paper we develop a practical homomorphic authentication scheme for cloud-assisted VANETs, where the healthcare monitoring for all involving passengers is provided. Notably, the integrated cloud-assisted VANET infrastructure is utilized, where the hybrid medical data acquisition module is attached. In this way, timely, non-contact measurement on all passengers' physical status can be remotely done by vehicular cloud (VC), which could also drastically improve the efficiency and guarantee safety. Vulnerabilities of the employed dedicated-short-range-communication (DSRC) technique could be properly addressed with the applied homomorphic encryption design. Additionally, the decentralized blockchain-based vehicle recording mechanism is cooperatively performed by VC and edge units. Infection tracking on specific vehicle and individual can be offered in this way. Each signature sequence is collaboratively maintained and verified by the current roadside unit (RSU) and its neighbor RSUs. The security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme is secure against major attacks, while the performance comparison with the state-of-the-arts relevant methods are presented for efficiency discussion."

The whole object detection algorithm can be divided into three stages: image enhancement, edge detection and object detection. In the image enhancement step, The system deals with the low contrast, blur and noises characteristics of underwater images by means of contrast normalization, median filtering, wavelet transform, and finally gets high quality images. Then, the Canny operator was used to extract object's edge features. Finally, for the emergence of noise edges, a robust algorithm named Random Sample Consensus was chosen to accurately detect linear object and estimate its parameters such as position and direction. This algorithm has been tested on the experimental data in the boat tank of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, collected with a range-gated imaging system.

Due to inherent wireless communicating features in open environment, secure transmission among numerous VANET entities remains crucial issues. Currently, lots of research efforts have been made, while most of which tend to allocate the universal group key to the verified devices for both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-RSU (V2R) communications. However, in heterogeneous VANET environment with large numbers of devices in same vehicular group, complicated and variable topologies lead to continuous key updating in every moment, causing interference to regular V2R data exchange, which is not reliable and efficient for resource-constrained VANET environment. Moreover, group membership recording and detecting mechanisms are necessary for real time vehicle revocation and participation, which has not been further studied so far. In this paper, we address the above issues by proposing a secure authentication and key management scheme. In our design, novel VANET system model with edge computing infrastructure is adopted so as to offer adequate computing and storing capacity compared to traditional VANET structure. Note that our certificateless authentication scheme applies the independent session key for each vehicle for interference avoidance. Furthermore, consortium blockchain is employed for V2V group key construction. Real time group membership arrangement with efficient group key updating is accordingly provided. Formal security proofs are presented, demonstrating that the proposed scheme can achieve desired security properties.

Due to the difficulty of finding the controller gain, we focus on finding the optimal controller among a sub-family whose design is based on Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) and guarantee consensus. It is found that the energy cost for such controllers is bounded by an interval and hence we minimize the upper bound. To do that, the control gain and the edge weights are optimized separately. The control gain is optimized by choosing Q = 0 in the ARE; the edge weights are optimized under the assumption that there is limited communication resources in the network. Negative edge weights are allowed, and the problem is formulated as a Semi-definite Programming (SDP) problem. The controller coincides with the optimal control in [8] when the graph is complete. Furthermore, two sufficient conditions for the existence of negative optimal edge weights realization are given."

Using this mechanism, we design a static asynchronous edge-based event-triggered protocol and an adaptive one, both of which guarantee the achievement of the leader-follower consensus and the exclusion of the Zeno behavior.

In order to overcome the drawback that the design of control protocols depends on the global information of the network in previous works, a novel distributed consensus protocol, updating the weights of the directed spanning tree of the communication network (directed spanning tree based adaptive control protocol), is developed. A scheme for reordering the nodes is proposed, and by using this scheme, an equivalent lemma for achieving consensus is given. Applying the developed method and Lyapunov stability theory, some distributed adaptive laws are designed on the coupling weights in a directed network. It is found that the consensus can be reached by randomly choosing a directed spanning tree and using the developed distributed adaptive laws. Furthermore, by reordering the nodes and using the proposed adaptive laws, one obtains that the leader-following consensus can be reached by pinning a small fraction of nodes. For both, with the leader and leaderless cases, it is also found that the designed adaptive law on the weight of the directed spanning tree depends on the position of the head node of the directed edge in the directed spanning tree. Finally, three examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical analysis."

Nodes in the WSN take spatial samples of the random field, then each node estimates the values of arbitrary points on the random field by iteratively exchanging information with each other, without the need of a central controller. The objective is to minimize the time (or number of iterations) required for all nodes in the network to reach a distributed consensus on the estimation result, with mean squared error (MSE) below a certain threshold. We find the sufficient conditions for this optimization problem, and identify the asymptotically optimum solutions when time is large and the MSE threshold is small. Specifically, we propose a distributed iterative estimation algorithm that defines the procedures for both information propagation and information estimation in each iteration. The key parameters of the algorithm, including an edge weight matrix and a sample weight matrix, are designed by following the asymptotically optimum criteria. It is shown that the asymptotically optimum performance can be achieved by distributively projecting the measurement samples into a subspace related to the covariance matrices of data and noise samples. Simulation results show that all nodes in a large network can obtain accurate estimation results with only a few iterations."

This connectivity concept applies to teams of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing cooperative tasks, such as arriving at a consensus. As a UAV team completes its mission, it often needs to control the network connectivity. The algebraic connectivity can be controlled by altering edge weights through movement of individual UAVs in the team, or by adding and deleting edges. The addition and deletion problem for algebraic connectivity, however, is NP-hard and caused multiple heuristic methods to be developed. A leading method, the greedy perturbation heuristic, is efficient but not always effective. An alternative method, the bisection method, is highly effective but less efficient. The primary contributions of this paper are identification of a set of features and a classifier for predicting when the greedy perturbation heuristic is successful, and presentation of a hybrid algorithm which combines these two methods to provide both effectiveness and efficiency."

To estimate collision time between ego-vehicle and target object, we set them with 2D modeling; using time, the relative distance and the relative velocity. The proposed algorithm has three stages; generating region of interest, locating target object and estimating time to collision. In the first stage, we used lane detection with Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) to generate region of interest. The second stage locates target object with shadow detection and edge information which have lite computational cost. Lastly, in the third stage, time to collision is estimated from the differences of the calculated relative distance for each frame. To show the performance, the algorithm was evaluated by comparing the result of the relative distance from the proposed algorithm with the relative distance from ground truth."

However, non-standard transport trucks and unstructured field environments make it extremely difficult to identify and properly position loading containers. In this paper, a global model with three coordinate systems is established to describe a collaborative harvesting system. Then, a method based on depth perception is proposed to dynamically identify and position the truck container, including data preprocessing, point cloud pose transformation based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm, segmentation and projection of the upper edge, edge lines extraction and corner points positioning based on the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, and fusion and visualization of results on the depth image. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified by field experiments with different trucks. The results demonstrated that the identification accuracy of the container region is about 90%, and the absolute error of center point positioning is less than 100 mm. The proposed method is robust to containers with different appearances and provided a methodological reference for dynamic identification and positioning of containers in forage harvesting."

We transform each concept of static graph theory into dynamic terms, out of which a generalized dynamic graph theory naturally emerges. We present a framework for dynamic graphs and dynamic consensus networks. This framework introduces the idea of dynamic degree, adjacency, incident, and Laplacian matrices in a way that naturally extends these concepts from the static case. We consider controllability for dynamic consensus networks. The ideas developed for dynamic graph theory, in conjunction with the behavioral approach, lead to the development of a controllability analysis methodology for dynamic consensus networks. The controllability conditions obtained using the behavioral approach cannot be applied for the general dynamic networks, such as identical LTI nodes with dynamic edges or even in the more general case with heterogeneous nodes. This is because of scalability in such dynamic networks. Thus, we develop controllability conditions based on node and interconnection (edge) parameters that guarantee controllability of the overall dynamic network."

This paper investigates the consensus problem of nonlinear multiagent systems subject to the relative state saturations. Utilizing the incidence matrix and the edge Laplacian, the consensus problem of nonlinear multiagent systems with the relative state saturations can be cast into the stabilization problem of edge dynamics operating on the constrained set. Three types of protocols, namely continuous, intermittent, and adaptive state feedback protocols are, respectively, proposed for achieving the constrained consensus, and meanwhile yielding consensus values. A consensus analysis is provided by virtue of state saturation theory, switched system theory, adaptive theory, and Lyapunov stability theory. Output feedback protocol is also designed.

The basic reference architecture of IoT is characterized by the presence of three distinct layers. It includes the sensing layer, the network layer and the application layer. The proposed paper aims at providing an efficient platform to develop solutions for Internet of things. In the proposed paper a SOA layer is built on top of the network layer to manage the data and information. The current architecture of IoT does not offer consensus decision making.

As Dynamic Adaptive Streaming (DAS) is becoming the de facto paradigm for video delivery, there is growing evidence on how caching improves users' Quality of Experience (QoE) in DAS. However, there is no consensus on how to maximize the utilization of in-network caching resources. Specifically, there are conflicting proposals on the impact of caching based on its distance (in hops) from the network edge. That is, contrasting ubiquitous network-wide caching to edge-caching. Supporters of the ubiquitous caching paradigm propose bitrate-aware caching schemes for optimizing video streaming, while counter-proposals suggest that edge-caching only the highest bitrate with online transcoding, may offer superior performance to ubiquitous caching. In this paper, we answer a contentious question: Can transcoding at the edge outperform bitrate-aware ubiquitous caching for DAS? We devise an extensive simulation environment using NS-3 to contrast both paradigms, experimenting with different bandwidth fluctuation patterns, under the FESTIVE user-based bitrate adaptation protocol. Caching performance was evaluated under five established QoE metrics, gauging delivered video quality, playback freezing and bitrate oscillation. We further assume zero processing delay for online transcoding at the network edge, to contrast to an upper bound performance from the edge-caching paradigm. Our experiments demonstrate that neither transcoding nor bitrate-aware caching offer a silver bullet for all cases. We present our insights on networking scenarios where each model would dominate in performance, and present our concluding remarks on their development."

These advantages, however, are mitigated by the difficulty of guaranteeing IoT trustworthiness, which is still in its infancy. IoT trustworthiness is a must especially in critical domains (e.g., health, transportation) where humans become new components of an IoT system and their life is put at risk by system malfunctioning or breaches. In this article, we put forward the idea that trust in IoT can be boosted if and only if its automation and adaptation processes are based on trustworthy data. We therefore depart from a scenario that considers the quality of a single decision as the main goal of an IoT system and consider the trustworthiness of collected data as a fundamental requirement at the basis of a trustworthy IoT environment. We therefore define a methodology for data collection that filters =trusted data out according to trust rules evaluating the status of the devices collecting data and the collected data themselves. Our approach is based on blockchain and smart contracts and collects data whose trustworthiness and integrity are proven over time. The methodology balances trustworthiness and privacy and is experimentally evaluated in real-world and simulated scenarios using Hyperledger fabric blockchain."

Among different approaches, tree-based partitioning is reported to define homogeneous regions rigorously, without ad-hoc adjustments, in a computationally efficient manner. One of the shortcomings of tree-based partitioning is the so-called chaining problem that results in sub-optimal regions. We propose a consensus-based regionalization approach to address the chaining problem associated with a single tree, in particular the minimum spanning tree, by exploring a wide range of partitions via a set of random spanning trees (RST). We propose an algorithm, namely SKATER-CON, that partitions spatial data via a consensus-based framework from an ensemble of regionalizations defined by its deterministic counter-part, the SKATER algorithm applied along stochastic search paths defined by RSTs. SKATER-CON utilizes evidence accumulation to represent an ensemble of regionalizations as a similarity graph. The similarity graph represents spatial objects as vertexes and frequency at which objects are assigned to the same region in the ensemble as edge weights. Proposed algorithm determines consensus among different regionalization by partitioning the similarity graph using a multi-level graph partitioning algorithm (METIS). Spatial constraints are imposed on the similarity graph prior to partitioning to ensure spatial constraints are reflected in the consensus result. We rigorously test the quality of regions produced by SKATER-CON on a large, synthetically generated dataset. The synthetic dataset is the result of full-factorial experiments designed on number, fuzziness, geometry and size of regions. Same dataset is also used compare our approach against state-of-the-art regionalization algorithms (SKATER and ARISEL). Lastly, we show the value added by SKATER-CON compared to SKATER on a real-world dataset based on Ecological Marine Units (EMU) dataset."

However, due to the semicredibility nature of the IIoT cloud platforms, how to achieve secure storage, access control, information update and deletion for smart factory data, as well as the tracking and revocation of malicious users has become an urgent problem. To solve these problems, in this article, a blockchain-enhanced security access control scheme that supports traceability and revocability has been proposed in IIoT for smart factories. The blockchain first performs unified identity authentication, and stores all public keys, user attribute sets, and revocation list. The system administrator then generates system parameters and issues private keys to users. The domain administrator is responsible for formulating domain security and privacy-protection policies, and performing encryption operations. If the attributes meet the access policies and the user's ID is not in the revocation list, they can obtain the intermediate decryption parameters from the edge/cloud servers. Malicious users can be tracked and revoked during all stages if needed, which ensures the system security under the Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption and can resist multiple attacks. The evaluation has shown that the size of the public/private keys is smaller compared to other schemes, and the overhead time is less for public key generation, data encryption, and data decryption stages."

We hypothesized that evolution also acts as a suitable network perturbation and that integration of data from multiple closely related species can lead to improved reconstruction of gene regulatory networks. To test this hypothesis, we predicted networks from temporal gene expression data for 3,610 genes measured during early embryonic development in six Drosophila species and compared predicted networks to gold standard networks of ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq interactions for developmental transcription factors in five species. We found that (i) the performance of single-species networks was independent of the species where the gold standard was measured; (ii) differences between predicted networks reflected the known phylogeny and differences in biology between the species; (iii) an integrative consensus network that minimized the total number of edge gains and losses with respect to all single-species networks performed better than any individual network.

A consensus algorithm is proposed to have the modified Cuk converters work efficiently to achieve SOC equalization of the cells. In order to accelerate the equalizing process, one more converter is added in the conventional topology of the cell balancing system here. Since the convergence rate of the cell balancing is proportional to the magnitude of the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of the cell equalizing graph, the problem becomes how to determine the added edge that can increase the second smallest eigenvalue of its graph's Laplacian matrix at a maximum level. By solving a 0-1 programming issue, the position of the converter added within the cell balancing system can be obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that the equalizing time can be significantly reduced by just adding one converter properly in the conventional cell equalizing system."

Due to the nature of hierarchical representations learned in CNN, it is intuitive to design side networks utilizing the richer convolutional features to improve the edge detection. However, there is no consensus way to integrate the hierarchical information. In this paper, we propose an effective and end-to-end framework, named Bidirectional Additive Net (BAN), for image edge detection. In the proposed framework, we focus on two main problems: 1) how to design a universal network for incorporating hierarchical information sufficiently; and 2) how to achieve effective information flow between different stages and gradually improve the edge map stage by stage. To tackle these problems, we design a bottom-up and top-down architecture, where a bottom-up branch can gradually remove detailed or sharp boundaries to enable accurate edge detection and a top-down branch offers a chance of error-correcting by revisiting the low-level features that contain rich textual and spatial information.

In this paper, we propose two timescale hybrid federated learning (TT-HF), a semi-decentralized learning architecture that combines the conventional device-to-server communication paradigm for federated learning with device-to-device (D2D) communications for model training. In TT-HF, during each global aggregation interval, devices (i) perform multiple stochastic gradient descent iterations on their individual datasets, and (ii) aperiodically engage in consensus procedure of their model parameters through cooperative, distributed D2D communications within local clusters. With a new general definition of gradient diversity, we formally study the convergence behavior of TT-HF, resulting in new convergence bounds for distributed ML. We leverage our convergence bounds to develop an adaptive control algorithm that tunes the step size, D2D communication rounds, and global aggregation period of TT-HF over time to target a sublinear convergence rate of O(1/t) while minimizing network resource utilization. Our subsequent experiments demonstrate that TT-HF significantly outperforms the current art in federated learning in terms of model accuracy and/or network energy consumption in different scenarios where local device datasets exhibit statistical heterogeneity. Finally, our numerical evaluations demonstrate robustness against outages caused by fading channels, as well favorable performance with non-convex loss functions."

In these heterogeneous networks, the link speeds among worker nodes vary significantly, making it challenging for state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to perform efficient training. Both centralized and decentralized training approaches suffer from low-speed links. In this paper, we propose a decentralized approach, namely NetMax, that enables worker nodes to communicate via high-speed links and, thus, significantly speed up the training process. NetMax possesses the following novel features. First, it consists of a novel consensus algorithm that allows worker nodes to train model copies on their local dataset asynchronously and exchange information via peer-to-peer communication to synchronize their local copies, instead of a central master node (i.e., parameter server). Second, each worker node selects one peer randomly with a fine-tuned probability to exchange information per iteration. In particular, peers with high-speed links are selected with high probability. Third, the probabilities of selecting peers are designed to minimize the total convergence time. Moreover, we mathematically prove the convergence of NetMax. We evaluate NetMax on heterogeneous cluster networks and show that it achieves speedups of 3.7x, 3.4x, and 1.9x in comparison with the state-of-the-art decentralized training approaches Prague, Allreduce-SGD, and AD-PSGD, respectively."

Light nodes are vulnerable to data availability (DA) attacks where a malicious node hides an invalid portion of the block from the light nodes. Recently, a technique based on erasure codes called Coded Merkle Tree (CMT) was proposed by Yu et al. that enables light nodes to detect a DA attack with high probability. The CMT is constructed using LDPC codes for fast decoding but can fail to detect a DA attack if a malicious node hides a small stopping set of the code. To combat this, Yu et al. used well-studied techniques to design random LDPC codes with high minimum stopping set size. Although effective, these codes are not necessarily optimal for this application. In this paper, we demonstrate a more specialized LDPC code design to improve the security against DA attacks. We achieve this goal by providing a deterministic LDPC code construction that focuses on concentrating stopping sets to a small group of variable nodes rather than only eliminating stopping sets. We design these codes by modifying the Progressive Edge Growth algorithm into a technique called the entropy-constrained PEG (EC-PEG) algorithm. This new method demonstrates a higher probability of detecting DA attacks and allows for good codes at short lengths."

To formally study this trade-off, we restrict our consideration to a class of commonly studied multi-agent problems where the objective function is the sum of a set of edge potential functions. The gradient descent algorithm and Newton's method are viewed as the proxy for the pure execution and the pure communication strategy, respectively. We propose an algorithm based on truncated Newton's method that provides tunable levels of trade-off between communication and execution efforts.

Such negative edges may prevent a network from performing cooperative tasks such as achieving consensus, creating a need for new control-theoretic techniques that guarantee performance in the presence of negative edges. This paper considers the problem of selecting leader nodes to maintain a fixed state in order to steer the remaining nodes to a desired state value in networks with negative edges. We present two sufficient conditions that are equivalent to submodular constraints on the set of leader nodes. The first constraint is based on the graph spectrum, while the second is formulated in terms of the determinant of the Laplacian matrix. We prove that both conditions can be formulated as submodular constraints on the set of leader nodes, leading to polynomial-time algorithms with provable approximation guarantees for selecting a minimum-size set of leader nodes to satisfy these conditions. Furthermore, we introduce necessary conditions for consensus and prove that a set of leader nodes satisfying these conditions can be selected in polynomial time. We characterize the requirements for leader selection in order to ensure consensus in line networks. The results are illustrated through numerical study."

While in the literature we may find innovative proposals to enhance the privacy of IoT applications, many of those only focus on the edge layer. On the other hand, privacy by design approaches are required throughout the whole system (e.g., at the cloud layer), in order to guarantee robust solutions to privacy in IoT. With this in mind, we propose an architecture that leverages the properties of blockchain, integrated with other technologies, to address security and privacy in the context of IoT applications. The main focus of our proposal is to enhance the privacy of the users and their data, using the anonymisation properties of blockchain to implement user-controlled privacy. We consider an IoT application with mobility for smart vehicles as our usage case, which allows us to implement and experimentally evaluate the proposed architecture and mechanisms as a proof of concept. In this application, data related to the user's identity and location needs to be shared with security and privacy.

This paradigm is particularly interesting in (federated) scenarios where is beneficial to decouple heavy processing from the core cloud and distributed it closer to end-users, such as in edge clouds. To provide such wide-area (federated) virtual network services, a distributed architecture should orchestrate processes to allow instantiation and maintenance of virtual paths hosting service function chains, while guaranteeing performance and fast convergence, even in presence of failures. To this end, we propose Catena, an architecture for resilient distributed service function chain instantiation. To instantiate a service chain, Catena uses a fully distributed asynchronous consensus mechanism that has bounds on convergence time and guarantees an optimal (1-1/e)approximation with respect to the Pareto optimal centralized chain instantiation, even in presence of (non-byzantine) failures. We leverage stochastic optimization theory to design Catena, and we evaluate its performance and policy tradeoffs with simulations and on a (released) prototype implementation, finding surprising results and demonstrating policy programmability for the resilient distributed chain instantiation problem."

Conventional learning methods, such as gathering all the raw data to train an ultimate model in a centralized way, or training a target model in a distributed manner under the parameter server framework, suffer a high communication cost. In this paper, we design Select Neighbors and Parameters (SNAP), a communication efficient distributed machine learning framework, to mitigate the communication cost. A distinct feature of SNAP is that the edge servers act as peers to each other. Specifically, in SNAP, every edge server hosts a copy of the global model, trains it with the local data, and periodically updates the local parameters based on the weighted sum of the parameters from its neighbors (i.e., peers) only (i.e., without pulling the parameters from all other edge servers). Different from most of the previous works on consensus optimization in which the weight matrix to update parameter values is predefined, we propose a scheme to optimize the weight matrix based on the network topology, and hence the convergence rate can be improved. Another key idea in SNAP is that only the parameters which have been changed significantly since the last iteration will be sent to the neighbors. Both theoretical analysis and simulations show that SNAP can achieve the same accuracy performance as the centralized training method. Compared to the state-of-the-art communication-aware distributed learning scheme TernGrad, SNAP incurs a significantly lower (99.6% lower) communication cost."

A very pertinent question therefore is could this system be improved?. In this paper, we attempt to present an answer to this question by considering a massive dataset of around 29k papers with roughly 70k distinct review reports together consisting of 12m lines of review text from the Journal of High Energy Physics (JHEP) between 1997 and 2015. In specific, we introduce a novel reviewer-reviewer interaction network (an edge exists between two reviewers if they were assigned by the same editor) and show that surprisingly the simple structural properties of this network such as degree, clustering coefficient, centrality (closeness, betweenness etc.) serve as strong predictors of the long-term citations (i.e., the overall scientific impact) of a submitted paper. These features, when plugged in a regression model, alone achieves a high R-2 of 0.79 and a low RMSE of 0.496 in predicting the long-term citations. In addition, we also design a set of supporting features built from the basic characteristics of the submitted papers, the authors and the referees (e.g., the popularity of the submitting author, the acceptance rate history of a referee, the linguistic properties laden in the text of the review reports etc.), which further results in overall improvement with R-2 of 0.81 and RMSE of 0.46. Analysis of feature importance shows that the network features constitute the best predictors for this task.

Considering only linkages that appeared in the consensus network for each culture (exceeding the determined frequency cutoff of >= 60%), the resulting Cornell D2 and KB-1 (R) consensus networks maintained 1,105 nodes (genes or conditions) with 974 edges and 1,714 nodes with 1,455 edges, respectively. These consensus networks captured multiple strong and biologically informative relationships. One of the main highlighted relationships shared between these two cultures was a direct edge between the transcript encoding for the major reductive dehalogenase (tceA (D2) or vcrA (KB-1 (R))) and the transcript for the putative S-layer cell wall protein (DET1407 (D2) or KB1_1396 (KB-1 (R))). Additionally, transcripts for two key oxidoreductases (a [Ni Fe] hydrogenase, Hup, and a protein with similarity to a formate dehydrogenase, Fdh) were strongly linked, generalizing a strong relationship noted previously for Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain 195 to multiple strains of Dehalococcoides. Notably, the pangenome array utilized when monitoring the KB-1 (R) culture was capable of resolving signals from multiple strains, and the network inference engine was able to reconstruct gene networks in the distinct strain populations."

It is necessary to develop a non-invasive fast detection system for that disease. Such a system will use multispectral imagery acquired at a close range with a camera attached to a mobile cart's mechanic extension. This study evaluated three image registration methods applied to non-georeferenced multispectral images acquired at close range over greenhouse cucumber plants with a MicaSense(R) RedEdge camera. The detection of matching points was performed using Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), and outliers matching points were removed using the M-estimator Sample Consensus (MSAC) algorithm. Three geometric transformations (affine, similarity, and projective) were considered in the registration process. For each transformation, we mapped the matching points of the blue, green, red, and NIR band images into the red-edge band space and computed the root mean square error (RMSE in pixel) to estimate the accuracy of each image registration. Our results achieved an RMSE of less than 1 pixel with the similarity and affine transformations and of less than 2 pixels with the projective transformation, whatever the band image. We determined that the best image registration method corresponded to the affine transformation because the RMSE is less than 1 pixel and the RMSEs have a Gaussian distribution for all of the bands, but the blue band."

To address problems such as low detection accuracy of traditional methods and poor real-time performance of deep learning-based methodologies, a lane detection algorithm for intelligent vehicles in complex road conditions and dynamic environments was proposed. Firstly, converting the distorted image and using the superposition threshold algorithm for edge detection, an aerial view of the lane was obtained via region of interest extraction and inverse perspective transformation. Secondly, the random sample consensus algorithm was adopted to fit the curves of lane lines based on the third-order B-spline curve model, and fitting evaluation and curvature radius calculation were then carried out on the curve. Lastly, by using the road driving video under complex road conditions and the Tusimple dataset, simulation test experiments for lane detection algorithm were performed. The experimental results show that the average detection accuracy based on road driving video reached 98.49%, and the average processing time reached 21.5 ms. The average detection accuracy based on the Tusimple dataset reached 98.42%, and the average processing time reached 22.2 ms. Compared with traditional methods and deep learning-based methodologies, this lane detection algorithm had excellent accuracy and real-time performance, a high detection efficiency and a strong anti-interference ability. The accurate recognition rate and average processing time were significantly improved.

The system is blockchain-based and provides data provenance, auditing, and control for shared medical data in cloud repositories among big data entities. MeDShare monitors entities that access data for malicious use from a data custodian system. In MeDShare, data transitions and sharing from one entity to the other, along with all actions performed on the MeDShare system, are recorded in a tamper-proof manner. The design employs smart contracts and an access control mechanism to effectively track the behavior of the data and revoke access to offending entities on detection of violation of permissions on data. The performance of MeDShare is comparable to current cutting edge solutions to data sharing among cloud service providers.

Remote sensing data is of great value, but the government is still the largest buyer behind the massive remote sensing data, and the commercial value of remote sensing has not been well discovered. In the future, data sharing will be one of the most effective methods in order to stimulate the commercial development of remote sensing data. Open sharing of data not only drives innovation in technology and industry, but also breaks down data barriers between various sectors of the economy, and generates great economic value for the country. According to this idea, this paper puts forward the remote sensing data sharing model which can conform to the development under the general trend of remote sensing data sharing. Remote sensing data often involves a series of security issues that need attention, such as land, so it is special. The remote sensing data involved in this paper is limited to commercially available data with the purpose of promoting the commercial development of remote sensing. The remote sensing data sharing envisaged in this paper involves remote sensing data that is built on the basis of being screened, not endangering or disclosing national geographic security information, and such data processing will help make people's life more convenient.

MongoDB provides linearizability and tolerates any minority of failures through a novel consensus protocol that derives from Raft. A major difference between our protocol and vanilla Raft is that MongoDB deploys a unique pull-based data synchronization model: a replica pulls new data from another replica. This pull-based data synchronization in MongoDB can be initiated by any replica and can happen between any two replicas, as opposed to vanilla Raft, where new data can only be pushed from the primary to other replicas. This flexible data transmission topology enabled by the pull-based model is strongly desired by our users since it has an edge on performance and monetary cost. This paper describes how this consensus protocol works, how MongoDB integrates it with the rest of the replication system, and the extensions of the replication protocol that support our rich feature set. Our evaluation shows that MongoDB effectively achieved the design goals and can replicate data efficiently and reliably."

The existing de novo repeat identification methods exploiting the use of short reads are impotent in identifying long repeats. Since long reads are more likely to cover repeat regions completely, using long reads is more favorable for recognizing long repeats. Results: In this study, we propose a novel de novo repeat elements identification method namely RepLong based on PacBio long reads. Given that the reads mapped to the repeat regions are highly overlapped with each other, the identification of repeat elements is equivalent to the discovery of consensus overlaps between reads, which can be further cast into a community detection problem in the network of read overlaps. In RepLong, we first construct a network of read overlaps based on pair-wise alignment of the reads, where each vertex indicates a read and an edge indicates a substantial overlap between the corresponding two reads. Secondly, the communities whose intra connectivity is greater than the inter connectivity are extracted based on network modularity optimization. Finally, representative reads in each community are extracted to form the repeat library. Comparison studies on Drosophila melanogaster and human long read sequencing data with genome-based and short-read-based methods demonstrate the efficiency of RepLong in identifying long repeats. RepLong can handle lower coverage data and serve as a complementary solution to the existing methods to promote the repeat identification performance on long-read sequencing data."

First, a rough horizon line is estimated with RANSAC in the gradient map of downsized image. Thus, a region of interest (ROI) is defined by the neighborhood of the estimated horizon. Then a proper amount of patches are sampled from the edge map of the original image in the ROI, and a straight line is fitted in each patch using RANSAC. Finally, patches with lower rate of outliers for their fitted lines are selected and aggregated to compute the final horizon via RANSAC. Experimental results on our own dataset with diverse scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach is more robust and more accurate than the traditional methods."

Such q-composite random key graphs allow modeling secure sensor networks employing the well-known q-composite key predistribution. For such graphs, we analyze the probabilities of having k-connectivity, k-robustness, a Hamilton cycle, and perfect matching, respectively. The derived results reveal that q-composite random key graphs exhibit a sharp transition for each property: as K-n increases, the probability of the property sharply increases. These results provide guidelines to design secure sensor networks for different control-related applications: distributed in-network parameter estimation, fault-tolerant consensus, and resilient data backup."

The roofs are assumed to consist of planar parts. Reconstruction is thus conducted using plane detection with random sample consensus (RANSAC), followed by a geometric refinement and merging of the neighbouring segments to reduce over segmentation. Planes belonging to the walls and ground are then detected and excluded, and the roof outlines are vectorized using the alpha-shapes algorithm. The resulting polygons are refined using straight three-dimensional (3-D) edges reconstructed through automatic edge extraction and matching, along with virtual 3-D edges from the intersection of adjacent planes. Additionally, 3-D corner points constructed through the intersection of the 3-D lines are used. The 3-D edges and corner points are integrated with the point clouds belonging to the planes, and the roof outlines are again detected using the alpha-shapes algorithm. Finally, a regularisation of the roof outlines is performed, although the topological correctness of the roof planes is not enforced. The quantitative evaluation uses several metrics for both the correctness and completeness of the roof polygons and for their geometric accuracy. The average mean and median value for the correctness of the roof polygons are 84 and 96%, respectively, and for completeness are 76 and 88%.

In the case of time-varying cost functions, based on the new distributed protocol in the case of time-invariant cost functions, a distributed protocol is provided by taking the Hessian matrix into account. In both cases, stability conditions are derived to ensure that the distributed optimization problem is solved under both fixed and switching communication topologies. A distinctive feature of the results in this paper is that an upper bound of settling time for consensus can be estimated without dependence on initial states of agents, and thus can be made arbitrarily small through adjusting system parameters. Therefore, the results in this paper can be applicable in an unknown environment such as drone rendezvous within a required time for military purpose while optimizing local objectives.

A new concept in facilitating distributed generation is peer-to-peer energy trading, where households exchange excess power with neighbors at a price they set themselves. However, little is known about the effects of peer-to-peer energy trading on the sociotechnical dynamics of electric power systems. Further, given the novelty of the concept, there are knowledge gaps regarding the impact of alternative electricity market structures and individual decision strategies on neighborhood exchanges and market outcomes. This study develops an empirical agent-based modeling (ABM) framework to simulate peer-to-peer electricity trades in a decentralized residential energy market. The framework is applied for a case study in Perth, Western Australia, where a blockchain-enabled energy trading platform was trialed among 18 households, which acted as prosumers or consumers. The ABM is applied for a set of alternative electricity market structures. Results assess the impact of solar generation forecasting approaches, battery energy storage, and ratio of prosumers to consumers on the dynamics of peer-to-peer energy trading systems. Designing an efficient, equitable, and sustainable future energy system hinges on the recognition of trade-offs on and across, social, technological, economic, and environmental levels. Results demonstrate that the ABM can be applied to manage emerging uncertainties by facilitating the testing and development of management strategies."

The factors affecting the performance of this restoration are how much prior information about an image and a blur kernel are provided and what algorithm is used to perform the restoration task. Prior information on images is often employed to restore the sharpness of the edges of an image. However, no consensus is present regarding what prior information to use in restoring from a blur kernel due to complex image blurring processes. In this paper, we propose modelling of a blur kernel as a sparse linear combinations of basic 2-D patterns. Our approach has a competitive edge over the existing blur kernel modelling methods because our method has the flexibility to customize the dictionary design, which makes it well-adaptive to a variety of applications. As a demonstration, we construct a dictionary formed by basic patterns derived from the Kronecker product of Gaussian sequences. We also compare our results with those derived by other state-of-the-art methods, in terms of improvement SNR (ISNR)."

Point cloud models are acquired from a RGB-D sensor, which provides the required color and depth information. Change detection is performed on robot view point cloud model. A bilateral filter smooths the surface and fills the holes as well as keeps the edge details on depth image. Registration of the point cloud model is implemented by using Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. It uses surface normal as the previous stage for the ground and wall estimate. After preprocessing the data, we create a point voxel model which defines voxel as surface or free space. Then we create a color model which defines each voxel that has a color by the mean of all points' color value in this voxel. The preliminary change detection is detected by XOR subtract on the point voxel model. Next, the eight neighbors for this center voxel are defined.

In this work, we study the effect of disorder in the emergence of QD and find that a highly disordered environment is greatly beneficial for it. By introducing the notion of lack of redundancy to quantify objectivity, we show that it behaves analogously to the entanglement entropy (EE) of the environmental eigenstate taken as an initial state. This allows us to estimate the many-body mobility edge by means of our Darwinistic measure, implicating the existence of a critical degree of disorder beyond which the degree of objectivity rises the larger the environment is. The latter hints the key role that disorder may play when the environment is of a thermodynamic size. At last, we show that a highly disordered evolution may reduce the spoiling of redundancy in the presence of intra-environment interactions."

Although previous works mainly focused on the boundedness of relative motion between satellites in the group, in this paper, an extra degree of freedom is also addressed in order to manipulate an arbitrary number of orbital elements, which is represented as coordinating a general orbital transfer and an in-space assembly. The underlying concept is using consensus theory to characterize the properties of the control objective as in a multiagent system. To that end, this paper assumes that the communication in the networked satellite system is represented as an undirected graph, and then implements the governing system dynamics in a control-affine form as described by the Gauss's variational equations. For the general orbital transfer problem, an edge-error-based controller is developed and proven asymptotically stable. Definitions of error functions are also investigated to understand the behavior of developed controllers. Several strategies for assembly control are discussed, namely, via changing of variables or in a two-phase control process based on the dynamical structure.

However, it is challenging to find important people among all individuals in an image directly based on their spatial or appearance information due to the existence of diverse variations of pose, action, appearance of persons and various changes of occasions. We overcome this challenge by constructing a multiple Hyper-Interaction Graph that treats each individual in an image as a node and inferring the most active node from the interactions estimated by using various types of cues. We model a pairwise interaction between people as an edge message communicated between nodes, resulting in a bidirectional pairwise-interaction graph. To enrich the person-person interaction estimation, we further introduce a unidirectional hyper-interaction graph that models the consensus of interactions between a focal person and any person in his/her local region around. Finally, we modify the PageRank algorithm to infer the activeness of people on the multiple Hybrid-Interaction Graph (HIG), the union of the pairwise-interaction and hyper-interaction graphs, and we call our algorithm the PersonRank.

Then, we consider the case when agents cannot know all other players' decisions, called a partial-decision information case. We introduce a local estimation of the overall agents' decisions and incorporate consensus dynamics on these local estimations. The two algorithms do not need any centralized clock coordination, fully exploit the local computation resource, and remove the idle time due to waiting for the slowest agent. Both algorithms are developed by preconditioned forward-backward operator splitting, and their convergence is shown by relating them to asynchronous fixed-point iterations, under proper assumptions and fixed and nondiminishing step-size choices. Numerical studies verify the algorithms' convergence and efficiency."

Yet, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), that are considered the de facto standard vision model, deal with the asymmetric case only in most cutting-edge CNNs-based optical flow techniques. We bridge this gap by introducing a novel model named SDOF-GAN: symmetric dense optical flow with generative adversarial networks (GANs). SDOF-GAN realizes a consistency between the forward mapping (source-to-target) and the backward one (target-to-source) by ensuring that they are inverse of each other with an inverse network. In addition, SDOF-GAN leverages a GAN model for which the generator estimates symmetric optical flow fields while the discriminator differentiates the real ground-truth flow field from a fake estimation by assessing the flow warping error. Finally, SDOF-GAN is trained in a semi-supervised fashion to enable both the precious labeled data and large amounts of unlabeled data to be fully-exploited. We demonstrate significant performance benefits of SDOF-GAN on five publicly-available datasets in contrast to several representative state-of-the-art models for optical flow estimation."

Exacerbations, the sudden and sustained worsening of symptoms, can lead to hospitalization and reduce quality of life. Major limitations of previous telemonitoring interventions for COPD include low compliance, lack of consensus on what constitutes an exacerbation, limited numbers of patients, and short monitoring periods. We developed a telemonitoring system based on a digital health platform that was used to collect data from the 1-year EDGE (Self Management and Support Programme) COPD clinical trial aiming at daily monitoring in a heterogeneous group of patients with moderate to severe COPD. Objective: The objectives of the study were as follows: first, to develop a systematic and reproducible approach to exacerbation identification and to track the progression of patient condition during remote monitoring; and second, to develop a robust algorithm able to predict COPD exacerbation, based on vital signs acquired from a pulse oximeter. Methods: We used data from 110 patients, with a combined monitoring period of more than 35,000 days. We propose a finite-state machine-based approach for modeling COPD exacerbation to gain a deeper insight into COPD patient condition during home monitoring to take account of the time course of symptoms. A robust algorithm based on short-period trend analysis and logistic regression using vital signs derived from a pulse oximeter is also developed to predict exacerbations. Results: On the basis of 27,260 sessions recorded during the clinical trial (average usage of 5.3 times per week for 12 months), there were 361 exacerbation events. There was considerable variation in the length of exacerbation events, with a mean length of 8.8 days. The mean value of oxygen saturation was lower, and both the pulse rate and respiratory rate were higher before an impending exacerbation episode, compared with stable periods. On the basis of the classifier developed in this work, prediction of COPD exacerbation episodes with 60%-80% sensitivity will result in 68%-36% specificity. Conclusions: All 3 vital signs acquired from a pulse oximeter (pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate) are predictive of COPD exacerbation events, with oxygen saturation being the most predictive, followed by respiratory rate and pulse rate. Combination of these vital signs with a robust algorithm based on machine learning leads to further improvement in positive predictive accuracy."

Inspired by our previous studies of tethered live dragonflies, here, a quantitative characterization of the unsteady aerodynamic features of a live, freely flying dragonfly under well-established level flight condition will be presented. In particular with regard of the span-wise features of vortex interactions between the fore- and hind-pairs of wings, that highly contributes to the flight agility and efficiency of dragonflies. Flow fields of free flying dragonflies in still air have been measured by time-resolved stereo particle image velocimetry (TRS_PIV). A specifically designed dark flight chamber has been built, where hand hold dragonflies (Pantala flavescens) were released and made to fly nearly parallel to the measurement plane toward a guiding light. Realistic kinematics of the dragonfly wings in free flight were. measured by filming with 2 synchronized high-speed video cameras. Using the recorded images, several dozens of landmarks on the fore- and hind-wing surfaces and several landmarks on the body were traced with high precision and the three-dimensional coordinates were then reconstructed with a direct linear transformation (DLT) method. Using the reconstructed wing-body model, Navier-Stokes-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses, with wing shapes prescribed based on the experimental measurement, dynamically moving multi blocked, and an overset-grid system were conducted. The numerical results are in overall agreement with the PIV data, and the combined numerical and experimental approach offers valuable insight into aerodynamic analyses. The results show that the interaction with the forewing leading edge vortex (LEV) strongly influences the flow structures around the inner spanwise region of the hindwing, while aerodynamic enhancement via vortex capture in the outer span is observed. The interaction depends not solely on wing phasing, geometrical arrangement, but also the flight mission."

IP names the attachment points (where) to facilitate ubiquitous interconnectivity as the current way to deliver data. The fundamental mismatch between data delivery and naming attachment points leads to a lot of challenges, e.g., mapping from data name to IP address, handling dynamics of underlying topology, scaling up the data distribution, and securing communication, etc. Information-centric networking (ICN) is proposed to shift the focus of communication paradigm from where to what, by making the named data the first-class citizen in the network, The basic consensus of ICN is to name the data independent from its container (space dimension) and session (time dimension), which breaks the limitation of point-to-point IP semantic. It scales up data distribution by utilizing available resources, and facilitates communication to fit diverse connectivity and heterogeneous networks. However, there are only a few consensuses on the detailed design of ICN, and quite a few different ICN architectures are proposed. This paper reveals the rationales of ICN from the perspective of the Internet evolution, surveys different design choices, and discusses on two debatable topics in ICN, i.e., self-certifying versus hierarchical names, and edge versus pervasive caching. We hope this survey helps clarify some mis-understandings on ICN and achieve more consensuses."

Ab-initio results confirm measured core level energies, connecting and explaining XANES spectra with h-DFT electronic structures. While P can diffuse into SiNCs and predominantly resides on interstitial sites, its ionization probability is extremely low, rendering P unsuitable for introducing electrons into SiNCs embedded in SiO2. Increased sample conductivity and photoluminescence (PL) quenching previously assigned to ionized P donors originate from deep defect levels due to P."

The inspections of overground power submission lines include corridor clearance monitoring and fault identification. The power lines corridor is a three-dimensional space around power cables defined by a set distance. Any obstacles breaching this space should be detected, as they potentially threaten the safety of the infrastructure. Corridor clearance monitoring is usually performed either by a labor-intensive total station survey (TS), terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), or expensive airborne laser scanning (ALS) from a plane or a helicopter. This paper proposes a method that uses unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images to monitor corridor clearance. To maintain the adequate accuracy of the relative position of wires in regard to surrounding obstacles, the same data were used both to reconstruct a point cloud representation of a digital surface model (DSM) and a 3D power line. The proposed algorithm detects power lines in a series of images using decorrelation stretch for initial image processing, the modified Prewitt filter for edge enhancement, random sample consensus (RANSAC) with additional parameters for line fitting, and epipolar geometry for 3D reconstruction. DSM points intruding into the corridor are then detected by calculating the spatial distance between a reconstructed power line and the DSM point cloud representation. Problematic objects are localized by segmenting points into voxels and then subsequent clusterization. The processing results were compared to the results of two verification methods-TS and TLS. The comparison results show that the proposed method can be used to survey power lines with an accuracy consistent with that of classical measurements."

Due to the low SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio), lack of star point texture information and vulnerability of atmospheric turbulence of the starry image properties, traditional mosaic methods are prone to failures during feature point extraction. In this paper, Spatio-Temporal Context (STC) filtering is introduced as the preprocessing procedure to suppress the background interferences. We have improved the classical STC filtering and expands it into multi-scale space combining with Rolling-Guidance Filtering Algorithm (RGFA). Making full use of the fine edge-preserving feature of RGFA, the time-variant or spatial-variant interference and noise in the background, such as glimmer stars, night clouds, sensor response noise, etc, are suppressed while the profiles of the target star points are enhanced and easy to extract their centroids. Then, we produced the feature description of the star-point sets via threshold segmentation and morphological algorithms based on geometric invariant cost function for the input image pairs to be stitched. After Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) processing, the mismatched feature point pairs in the star-point sets are excluded. The subsequent procedures of the registration parameter calculation, image fusion and parallax correction processing are adopted to complete the mosaic processing. The results of digital simulation and practical processing show that the proposed method for the multichannel sequence starry images with the low SNR and complex backgrounds can extract feature points more precisely and more robustly comparing with the traditional methods. So, it is suitable for the large FOV spatial observation or surveillance applications."

For investment, one of the most valuable pieces of information is the company's unexpected revenue, which is the difference between the officially reported revenue and the consensus estimate for revenue predicted by analysts. Since it is the unexpected revenue that indicates something exceeding or under analysts' expectation, it is an indispensable factor that influences the performance of a stock. Besides conventional trading data from stock market and companies' financial reports, recent years have witnessed an extensive application of alternative data for gaining an information edge in stock investment. In this paper, we study the challenging problem of better predicting unexpected revenue of a company via machine learning with alternative data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying this problem in literature. However, it is nontrivial to quantitatively model the relations between the unexpected revenue and the information provided by alternative data with a machine learning approach. Thus we proposed an adaptive master-slave regularized model, called AMS for short, to effectively leverage alternative data for unexpected revenue prediction. AMS first trains a master model upon a company graph, which captures the relations among companies, using a graph neural network (GNN). Then for a target company, the master model generates an adaptive slave-model, which is specially optimized for this target company. Finally, we use this slave-model to predict the unexpected revenue of the target company. Besides its excellent prediction performance, another critical advantage of our AMS model lies in its superior interpretability, which is crucial for portfolio managers to understand the predicted results. With extensive experiments using two real-world alternative datasets, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model against a set of competitors."

These peptides represent a simplified consensus motif for transmembrane domains of intrinsic membrane proteins due to their hydrophobic core of alternating leucine and alanine flanked by membrane-anchoring aromatic tryptophan residues. Although the modulation of mismatch responses in WALPs by tryptophan anchors has been reported earlier, there have been limited attempts to utilize the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of this class of peptides in mismatch sensors. We have previously shown, utilizing the red edge excitation shift (REES) approach, that interfacial WALP tryptophan residues in fluid phase bilayers experience a dynamically constrained membrane microenvironment. Interestingly, emerging reports suggest the involvement of non-aromatic interfacially localized residues in modulating local structure and dynamics in WALP analogs. In this backdrop, we have explored the effect of interfacial amino acids, such as lysine (in KWALPs) and glycine (in GWALPs), on the tryptophan microenvironment of WALP analogs in zwitterionic and negatively charged membranes. We show that interfacial tryptophans in KWALP and GWALP experience a more restricted microenvironment, as reflected in the substantial increase in magnitude of REES and apparent rotational correlation time, relative to those in WALP in zwitterionic membranes. Interestingly, in contrast to WALP, the tryptophan anchors in KWALP and GWALP appear insensitive to the presence of negatively charged lipids in the membrane. These results reveal a subtle interplay between non-aromatic flanking residues in transmembrane helices and negatively charged lipids at the membrane interface, which could modulate the membrane microenvironment experienced by interfacially localized tryptophan residues. Since interfacial tryptophans are known to influence mismatch responses in WALPs, our results highlight the possibility of utilizing the fluorescence signatures of tryptophans in membrane proteins or model peptides such as WALP as markers for assessing protein responses to hydrophobic mismatch. More importantly, these results constitute one of the first reports on the influence of lipid headgroup charge in fine-tuning hydrophobic mismatch in membrane bilayers, thereby enriching the existing framework of hydrophobic mismatch."

Fog service providers typically monetize their service usage via centralized payment mechanisms in unverifiable and non-transparent manner. Therefore, there exists a need for a trust-enabling payment mechanism whereby fog service providers should be incentivized or penalized based upon the continuous feedback from endpoint devices. We propose a decentralized reverse-bidding scheme developed using the key features of blockchain and smart contracts. We develop a solution that allows the users or devices to initiate the bidding process by making a request for services to be provided by nearby public fog nodes, and these fog nodes to make bid offers in return. The proposed scheme ensures that all fog nodes on the network can equally and fairly make offers to win the bid. The bidding process incorporates the automated payments at the end of the service. Our solution is implemented using Ethereum smart contracts. It also integrates a reputation system for fog nodes and imposes a penalty for misbehaving nodes. Our solution is fully decentralized and provides a high level of trust, transparency, and security. In the paper, we present the system architecture, implementation details, and show the correct functionality of the overall proposed solution. In addition, we provide performance, cost, and security analyses of the smart contract code to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness against major security concerns. The results show that the cost of running the smart contract remained less than three cents with the current Ethereum price (i.e., 183.22 USD/Eth).

It brings many advantages, but various peculiarities must be perceived, such as security, resource management, storage, and other features at the same time. This paper investigates the resource contribution model between the fog node and cloud or users when fog computing introduces blockchain. The proposed model practices the reward and punishment mechanism of the blockchain to boost the fog nodes to contribute resources actively. The behavior of the fog node in contributing resources and the completion degree of the task also for contributing resources are packaged into blocks and stored in the blockchain system to form a transparent, open, and tamper-free service evaluation index. The differential game method is employed to model and solve the above process and address the interaction between the optimal resource contribution strategy of the fog node and the optimal benefit under the optimal resource contribution strategy. Indirectly, this service evaluation index also brings long-term economic benefits to fog service providers. Besides, taking advantage of the performance characteristics of the collective maintenance of blockchain and the ability to establish a credible consensus mechanism in an untrusted environment, fog computing nodes, under the proposed architecture, can have specific security protection capabilities."

To maintain a canonical state of blockchain data record, proof-of-work based consensus protocols provide the nodes, referred to as miners, in the network with incentives for confirming new block of transactions through a process of block mining by solving a cryptographic puzzle. Under the circumstance of limited local computing resources, e.g., mobile devices, it is natural for rational miners, i.e., consensus nodes, to offload computational tasks for proof of work to the cloud/fog computing servers. Therefore, we focus on the trading between the cloud/fog computing service provider and miners, and propose an auction-based market model for efficient computing resource allocation. In particular, we consider a proof-of-work based blockchain network, which is constrained by the computing resource and deployed as an infrastructure for decentralized data management applications. Due to the competition among miners in the blockchain network, the allocative externalities are particularly taken into account when designing the auction mechanisms. Specifically, we consider two bidding schemes: the constant-demand scheme where each miner bids for a fixed quantity of resources, and the multi-demand scheme where the miners can submit their preferable demands and bids. For the constant-demand bidding scheme, we propose an auction mechanism that achieves optimal social welfare. In the multi-demand bidding scheme, the social welfare maximization problem is NP-hard. Therefore, we design an approximate algorithm which guarantees the truthfulness, individual rationality and computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposed auction mechanisms with the two bidding schemes can efficiently maximize the social welfare of the blockchain network and provide effective strategies for the cloud/fog computing service provider."

In order to maintain a secured, universal state of the blockchain, PoW-based consensus protocols financially incentivize the nodes in the network to compete for the privilege of block generation through cryptographic puzzle solving. For rational consensus nodes, i.e., miners with limited local computational resources, offloading the computation load for PoW to the cloud/fog providers (CFPs) becomes a viable option. In this paper, we study the interaction between the CFPs and the miners in a PoW-based blockchain network using a game theoretic approach. In particular, we propose a lightweight infrastructure of the PoW-based blockchains, where the computation-intensive part of the consensus process is offloaded to the cloud/fog. We formulate the computation resource management in the blockchain consensus process as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the profit of the CFP and the utilities of the individual miners are jointly optimized. In the first stage of the game, the CFP sets the price of offered computing resource. In the second stage, the miners decide on the amount of service to purchase accordingly. We apply backward induction to analyze the subgame perfect equilibria in each stage for both uniform and discriminatory pricing schemes. For uniform pricing where the same price applies to all miners, the uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium is validated by identifying the best response strategies of the miners. For discriminatory pricing where the different prices are applied, the uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium is proved by capitalizing on the variational inequality theory. Further, the real experimental results are employed to justify our proposed model."

Methods: The health-related data are generated by 2 types of IoT devices: wearable devices and stationary air quality sensors. The data sharing mechanism is enabled by IOTA's distributed ledger, the Tangle, which is a directed acyclic graph. Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) is adopted to facilitate data communications among different parties. Merkle Hash Tree is used for data encryption and verification. Results: A prototype system was built according to the proposed solution.

The centralized work method in the LoRa system, where all packages are processed and kept in the central cloud, cannot well exploit the resources in LoRa gateways and also makes it vulnerable to security risks, such as data falsification or data loss. On the other hand, the blockchain has the potential to provide a decentralized and secure infrastructure for the LoRa system. However, there are significant challenges in deploying blockchain at LoRa gateways with limited edge computing abilities. This article proposes a design and implementation of the blockchain-enabled LoRa system with edge computing by using the open-source Hyperledger Fabric, which is called as HyperLoRa. According to different features of LoRa data, a blockchain network with multiple ledgers is designed, each of which stores a specific kind of LoRa data. LoRa gateways can participate in the operations of the blockchain and share the ledger that keep the time-critical network data with small size. Then, the edge computing abilities of LoRa gateways are utilized to handle the join procedure and application packages processing. Furthermore, a HyperLoRa prototype is implemented on embedded hardware, which demonstrates the feasibility of deploying the blockchain into LoRa gateways with limited computing and storage resources. Finally, various experiments are conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed LoRa system."

Mobile users can offload some computations from the mobile devices to the nearby Fog servers so as to release the workloads of mobile devices, and therefore improve mobile users' quality of experience. However, mobile users may mistakenly offload their computations to the nearby Fog servers which have been injected by some attackers, and therefore induce some privacy and security issues. As most of mobile devices have natural mobility feature, it is very necessary to check the veracity of a Fog server in a very short time before doing computation offloading.

The stakeholders have no mutual trust but interest conflict, which means bad cooperation of them. Due to lack of trust, transferring raw data (e.g., pictures or video clips) between publisher and workers requires the remote platform center to serve as a relay node, which implies network congestion.

Under given incentive mechanisms, both D2D and MEC caching nodes' willingness is guaranteed by satisfying their expected reward for cache sharing. Besides, for the distributed CDM, content delivery related transactions are executed by smart contracts. To achieve consensus on transactions and prevent frauds, a consensus protocol among the smart contract execution nodes (SCENE) is necessary. To minimize the latency of reaching consensus while guaranteeing its confidence level, we propose partial Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pPBFT) protocol.

This paper contributes to three different aspects. First, we propose a novel metaheuristic approach for medical cost-efficient task schedules, where an intelligent scheduler manages the tasks, such as the rate of service schedule, and lists items utilized by users during the data processing and computation through the fog node. Second, the QoS efficient-computation algorithm, which effectively monitors performance according to the indicator (parameter) with the analysis mechanism of quality-of-experience (QoE), has been developed. Third, a framework of blockchain-distributed technology-enabled QoS (QoS-ledger) computation in healthcare applications is proposed in a permissionless public peer-to-peer (P2P) network, which stores medical processed information in a distributed ledger. We have designed and deployed smart contracts for secure medical-data transmission and processing in serverless peering networks and handled overall node-protected interactions and preserved logs in a blockchain distributed ledger. The simulation result shows that QoS is computed on the blockchain public network with transmission power = average of -10 to -17 dBm, jitter = 34 ms, delay = average of 87 to 95 ms, throughput = 185 bytes, duty cycle = 8%, route of delivery and response back variable.

Suffering from constrained computing resources due to their limited physical sizes, edge servers cannot always handle all the incoming computation tasks timely when they operate independently. They often need to cooperate through peer-offloading. Deployed and managed by different stakeholders, edge servers operate in a distrusted environment. Trust and incentive are the two main issues that challenge cooperative computing between them. Another unique challenge in the EC environment is to facilitate trust and incentive in a decentralized manner. To tackle these challenges systematically, this paper proposes CoopEdge, a novel blockchain-based decentralized platform, to drive and support cooperative edge computing. On CoopEdge, an edge server can publish a computation task for other edge servers to contend for. A winner is selected from candidate edge servers based on their reputations.

Fog, Edge and Dew computing as post-Cloud computing paradigms aim to relocate computing resources closer to end users in order to mitigate cloud-specific issues of highly centralized computation. Dew computing as the youngest of the post-cloud paradigms promotes human centered independence and collaboration between devices within scalable distributed computing infrastructures. Meanwhile, the field of artificial intelligence is adapting to recent challenges posed by user data privacy regulations as well as opportunities for applications on mobile devices based on their growing computational abilities. The usage of artificial intelligence in pervasive and scalable distributed computing systems is a natural step towards ubiquitous intelligent infrastructures and collaborative human and machine environments. Federated learning is an artificial intelligence technique enabling collaborative learning in distributed devices environment without sharing the training data sets, which are often private. This paper provides the overview of the federated learning paradigm showing that it inherently leverages both independence and collaboration, thus exemplifying implementation of dew intelligence within scalable distributed computing hierarchy."

In particular, we study optimal pricing-based edge computing resource management to support mobile blockchain applications where the mining process can be offloaded to an Edge computing Service Provider (ESP). We adopt a two-stage Stackelberg game to jointly maximize the profit of the ESP and the individual utilities of different miners. In Stage I, the ESP sets the price of edge computing services. In Stage II, the miners decide on the service demand to purchase based on the observed prices. We apply the backward induction to analyze the sub-game perfect equilibrium in each stage for uniform and discriminatory pricing schemes. Further, the existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg game are validated for both pricing schemes. At last, the performance evaluation shows that the ESP intends to set the maximum possible value as the optimal price for profit maximization under uniform pricing. In addition, the discriminatory pricing helps the ESP encourage higher total service demand from miners and achieve greater profit correspondingly."

Nevertheless, fast payments are usually on demand in such a scenario, but an open problem still remains on how to protect blockchain-based systems from double-spending attacks in the context of fast payment.

Due to extensive data exchange over the Internet, the smart grid faces many security challenges that have led to data loss, data compromise, and high power consumption. Moreover, the lack of hardware protection and physical attacks reduce the overall performance of the smart grid network. We proposed the BLIDSE model (Blockchain-based secure quantum key distribution and Intrusion Detection System in Edge Enables Smart Grid Network) to address these issues. The proposed model includes five phases: The first phase is blockchain-based secure user authentication, where all smart meters are first registered in the blockchain, and then the blockchain generates a secret key. The blockchain verifies the user ID and the secret key during authentication matches the one authorized to access the network. The secret key is shared during transmission through secure quantum key distribution (SQKD). The second phase is the lightweight data encryption, for which we use a lightweight symmetric encryption algorithm, named Camellia. The third phase is the multi-constraint-based edge selection; the data are transmitted to the control center through the edge server, which is also authenticated by blockchain to enhance the security during the data transmission. We proposed a perfect matching algorithm for selecting the optimal edge. The fourth phase is a dual intrusion detection system which acts as a firewall used to drop irrelevant packets, and data packets are classified into normal, physical errors and attacks, which is done by Double Deep Q Network (DDQN). The last phase is optimal user privacy management. In this phase, smart meter updates and revocations are done, for which we proposed Forensic based Investigation Optimization (FBI), which improves the security of the smart grid network. The simulation is performed using network simulator NS3.26, which evaluates the performance in terms of computational complexity, accuracy, false detection, and false alarm rate. The proposed BLIDSE model effectively mitigates cyber-attacks, thereby contributing to improved security in the network."

In this paper, a blockchain empowered group-authentication scheme is proposed for vehicles with decentralized identification based on secret sharing and dynamic proxy mechanism. Sub-authentication results are aggregated for trust management based blockchain to implement collaborative authentication. The edge computing node with a higher-reputation stored in the tamper-proof blockchain can upload the final aggregated authentication result to the central server to achieve the decentralized authentication.

One of the technologies based on the IoT is Long Range (LoRa). Apart from the increasing number of IoT services, security aspects become a separate issue in the development of the IoT. One of the solutions is to utilize blockchain technology in the IoT topology to secure the data and transactions that occur in the IoT network. The blockchain can take minutes to compute a cryptographic chain. It also needs sufficient computing resources. This problem gave rise to the idea of establishing a lightweight blockchain platform with low latency that could run on devices with low computing resources as well as IoT devices. We offered a technology called Lightweight Multi-Fog (LMF) in our previous publication that is implemented using the Lightweight Scalable Blockchain (LSB) algorithm and the fog network on the IoT to solve the problem of integrating a blockchain with the IoT. In this paper, we simulate how the broadcast domain on LMF works and verify the results in lower latency and energy transmission compared to the standard blockchain model. The results showed that the average increase of the total delivery time (T-average) on the LMF platform was smaller than the average increase of the total delivery time (T-average), which was 0.53% for the variations in the number of nodes and 0.27% for the variations in the number of brokers/miners. Regarding the average increase of the total energy delivery (E-average), the Proof of Work (PoW) platform has a smaller increase of the total energy delivery (E-average), which is 1.68% during the variations in the number of nodes.

However, the majority of passengers lean to find local drivers, but querying a remote cloud server leads to an unnecessary communication overhead and an increased response delay. Recently, fog computing is introduced to provide local data processing with low latency, but it also raises new security and privacy concerns because users' private information (e.g., identity and location) could be disclosed when these information are shared during carpooling. While they can be encrypted before transmission, it makes user matching a challenging task and malicious users can upload false locations. Moreover, carpooling records should be kept in a distributed manner to guarantee reliable data auditability. To address these problems, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving carpooling scheme using blockchain-assisted vehicular fog computing to support conditional privacy, one-to-many matching, destination matching, and data auditability. Specifically, we authenticate users in a conditionally anonymous way. Also, we adopt private proximity test to achieve one-to-many proximity matching and extend it to efficiently establish a secret communication key between a passenger and a driver. We store all location grids into a tree and achieve get-off location matching using a range query technique. A private blockchain is built to store carpooling records. Finally, we analyze the security and privacy properties of the proposed scheme, and evaluate its performance in terms of computational costs and communication overhead."

However, a mechanism for edge resource allocation to maximize the revenue for the ECSP and to ensure incentive compatibility and individual rationality is still open. In this paper, we develop an optimal auction based on deep learning for the edge resource allocation. Specifically, we construct a multi-layer neural network architecture based on an analytical solution of the optimal auction. The neural networks first perform monotone transformations of the miners' bids. Then, they calculate allocation and conditional payment rules for the miners. We use valuations of the miners as the training data to adjust parameters of the neural networks so as to optimize the loss function which is the expected, negated revenue of the ECSP. We show the experimental results to confirm the benefits of using the deep learning for deriving the optimal auction for mobile blockchain with high revenue."

The blockchain technology (BCT) has been proven as a promising solution to establish the trust of data and call for executions; theoretically, it can be used to support the interoperability of services. BCT verifies data or a process and stores it as a transaction in a distributed ledger. Similar to the topology to IoT, applying BCT at the edges of the network exhibits the distributed characteristic. However, currently, BCT is still facing the challenges for interoperability due to a number of factors such as consensus protocols, block sizes, and interval of blocks. Prominent protocols such as proof-of-work (PoW) may cause excessive delays in finality settlement. One promising protocol Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant offers a fast finality settlement and uses hyperledger to support the scalability; however, the trust might also be a concern if the validators are chosen improperly. This paper discusses the interoperability of IoT services and the challenges and proposes an architecture solution by integrating BCT, service-oriented architecture (SoA), and enablers of key performance indicators (KPIs) and service selections.

Due to the tremendous growth of various vehicular applications, a huge amount of data is generated through advanced on-board devices and is deemed critical to improve driving safety and enhance vehicular services. However, cloud based models often fall short in applications where latency and mobility are critical. In order to fully realize the potential of vehicular networks, the challenges of efficient communication and computation need to be addressed. In this direction, vehicular fog computing (VFC) has emerged which extends the concept of fog computing to conventional vehicular networks. It is a geographically distributed paradigm that has the potential to conduct time-critical and data-intensive tasks by pushing intelligence (i.e. computing resources, storage, and application services) in the vicinity of end vehicles. However secure and reliable transmission are of significant importance in highly-mobile vehicular networks in order to ensure the optimal Quality of Service (QoS). In this direction, several authentication mechanisms have been proposed in the literature but most of them are found unfit due to absence of decentralization, anonymity, and trust characteristics. Thus, an effective cross-datacenter authentication and key-exchange scheme based on blockchain and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is proposed in this paper. Here, the distributed ledger of blockchain is used for maintaining the network information while the highly secure ECC is employed for mutual authentication between vehicles and road side units (RSUs). Additionally, the proposed scheme is lightweight and scalable for the considered VFC setup. The performance evaluation results against the existing state-of-the-art reveal that the proposed scheme accomplishes enhanced security features with reduced computational and communicational overheads. Further, its extensive evaluation on the widely applicable Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool guarantee its safeness against different attack vectors."

Tapping into this unlimited reservoir of information presents the problem of finding quality data out of a myriad of irrelevant ones, which to this day, has been a significant issue in data science with a direct ramification of this being the inability to generate quality ML models for useful predictive analysis. Edge computing has been deemed a solution to some of issues such as privacy, security, data silos and latency, as it ventures to bring cloud computing services closer to end-nodes. A new form of edge computing known as edge-AI attempts to bring ML, AI, and predictive analytics services closer to the data source (end devices). In this paper, we investigate an approach to bring edge-AI to end-nodes through a shared machine learning model powered by the blockchain technology and a federated learning framework called iFLBC edge. Our approach addresses the issue of the scarcity of relevant data by devising a mechanism known as the Proof of Common Interest (PoCI) to sieve out relevant data from irrelevant ones. The relevant data is trained on a model, which is then aggregated along with other models to generate a shared model that is stored on the blockchain. The aggregated model is downloaded by members of the network which they can utilize for the provision of edge intelligence to end-users. This way, AI can be more ubiquitous as members of the iFLBC network can provide intelligence services to end-users."

However, many devices in the IIoT currently have a problem of low computing power, so these devices cannot perform well facing the tasks of training and updating models in federated learning. In order to solve the above problems, we introduce edge computing into the IIot, so that the device can complete the federated learning operation.

In this paper, we present a two-layer computation offloading paradigm that includes an edge computing service provider (ESP) and a cloud computing service provider (CSP). We formulate a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game to address the computing resource management problem in such a network, by jointly maximizing the profits of each service provider (SP) and the payoffs of individual miners. Two practical scenarios are investigated: a fixed-miner-number scenario for permissioned blockchains and a dynamic-miner-number scenario for permissionless blockchains. For the fixed-miner-number scenario, we discuss two different edge operation modes, i.e., the ESP is connected (to the CSP) or standalone, which form different miner subgames based on whether each miner's strategy set is mutually dependent. The existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) in both modes are analyzed, according to which algorithms are proposed to achieve the corresponding SE(s). For the dynamic-miner-number scenario, we focus on the impact of population uncertainty and find that the uncertainty inflates the aggressiveness in the ESP resource purchasing.

This integration ensures reliable access, distributed computation and untampered storage for scalable and secure transactions. It is imperative therefore that crucial issues of security, scalability and resources management be addressed to achieve successful integration. Studies have been conducted to explore suitable architectural requirements, and some researchers have applied the integration to deploy some specific applications. Despite these efforts, however, issues of anonymity, adaptability and integrity still need to be investigated further to attain a practical, secure decentralized data storage.

This can effectively reduce the network latency of service responses and the load of data centers. Furthermore, it can prevent the Internet's bandwidth from being used up due to massive data flows from end users to clouds. However, fog-computing resources are distributed over multiple levels of networks and are managed by different owners. Consequently, the problem of service discovery becomes quite complicated. For resolving this problem, a decentralized service discovery method is required. Accordingly, this research proposes a service discovery framework based on the distributed ledger technology of IOTA. The proposed framework enables clients to directly search for service nodes through any node in the IOTA Mainnet to achieve the goals of public access and high availability and avoid network attacks to distributed hash tables that are popularly used for service discovery. Moreover, clients can obtain more comprehensive information by visiting known nodes and select a fog node able to provide services with the shortest latency. Our experimental results have shown that the proposed framework is cost-effective for distributed service discovery due to the advantages of IOTA. On the other hand, it can indeed enable clients to obtain higher service quality by automatic node selection."

Hence, the idea of IoV edge computing (IoVEC) networks has grown to be an assuring paradigm with various opportunities to advance massive data storage, data sharing, and computing processing close to vehicles. However, the participant's vehicle may be unwilling to share their data since the data-sharing system still relies on a centralized server approach with the potential risk of data leakage and privacy security. In addition, vehicles have difficulty evaluating the credibility of the messages they received because of untrusted environments. To address these challenges, we propose consortium blockchain and smart contracts to accomplish a decentralized trusted data sharing management system in IoVEC. This system allows vehicles to validate the credibility of messages from their neighboring by generating a reputation rating. Moreover, the incentive mechanism is utilized to trigger the vehicles to store and share their data honestly; thus, they will obtain certain rewards from the system. Simulation results substantially display an efficient network performance along with forming an appropriate incentive model to reach a decentralized trusted data sharing management of IoVEC networks."

However, privacy issues during data collection for ML tasks raise extensive concerns. To solve this issue, synchronous federated learning (FL) is proposed, which enables the central servers and end devices to maintain the same ML models by only exchanging model parameters. However, the diversity of computing power and data sizes leads to a significant difference in local training data consumption, and thereby causes the inefficiency of FL. Besides, the centralized processing of FL is vulnerable to single-point failure and poisoning attacks. Motivated by this, we propose an innovative method, federated learning with asynchronous convergence (FedAC) considering a staleness coefficient, while using a blockchain network instead of the classic central server to aggregate the global model. It avoids real-world issues such as interruption by abnormal local device training failure, dedicated attacks, etc. By comparing with the baseline models, we implement the proposed method on a real-world dataset, MNIST, and achieve accuracy rates of 98.96% and 95.84% in both horizontal and vertical FL modes, respectively. Extensive evaluation results show that FedAC outperforms most existing models."

While existing schemes keep adding new functionalities (e.g., collaborative computing and caching), they overlook an important issue of establishing trustworthiness among all CEC participants. In general, due to the heterogeneity of all participants, simply assuming trustworthiness among them is undesirable. To address this issue, in this article, we present BlockEdge, a blockchain-powered framework that delivers trusted CEC services. Toward this end, BlockEdge first introduces incentive schemes to attract edge nodes to participate in CEC tasks. Then it publicly and persistently stores all task results on blockchain to enable smart-contract-based correctness verification and automated punishment in case of failures. Such a built-in accountability scheme allows BlockEdge to establish a trust reputation system for all CEC stakeholders, which can be further used for reliable selection of CEC participators. Our security analysis and experimental evaluation demonstrate that BlockEdge is both technically feasible and financially beneficial. We hope that the blockchain-based trustworthiness establishment designed in BlockEdge can provide a fundamental primitive for building a more secure collaborative ecosystem, especially for complex networks such as 5G and IoT."

As a result, Edge Computing (EC) has emerged to address these issues, by placing part of the cloud resources (e.g., computation, storage, logic) closer to the edge of the network, which allows faster and context dependent data analysis and storage. However, as EC infrastructures grow, different providers who do not necessarily trust each other need to collaborate in order serve different IoT devices. In this context, EC infrastructures, IoT devices and the data transiting the network all need to be subject to identity and provenance checks, in order to increase trust and accountability. Each device/data in the network needs to be identified and the provenance of its actions needs to be tracked. In this paper, we propose a blockchain container based architecture that implements the W3C-PROV Data Model, to track identities and provenance of all orchestration decisions of a business network. This architecture provides new forms of interaction between the different stakeholders, which supports trustworthy transactions and leads to a new decentralized interaction model for IoT based applications."

The primal-dual method of multipliers (PDMM) is an optimization algorithm that forms a consensus among nodes by exchanging latent variables rather than the data sets. PDMM often has a high rate of convergence. However, when the nodes see statistically heterogeneous data sets then the performance of PDMM degrades. To overcome this problem, we propose quadratic PDMM. In this method, the original cost functions are replaced by their quadratic majorization based on the L2 norm to ensure homogeneous convexity among nodes. We describe a method to set its parameters optimally for fast convergence. Our experiments confirm that the proposed quadratic PDMM provides good performance even when the data sets are heterogeneous."

Due to the connection to the Internet, the DR management in IoE faces a number of unique cyber-physical security challenges. First, as distributed energy resources have a large number of stakeholders and any illegal skip-level energy access may cause disastrous results, it requires fog computing paradigm to enforce a more secure DR management. Second, in the localized energy networks of IoE, a corrupt DR participator can maliciously read and write DR strategies by using collusion attacks (e.g., reputation-based cheating and unfair competing). To address these issues, we propose a fog computing-enabled secure demand response (FSDR) scheme for IoE against collusion attacks using consensus and access control encryption. In FSDR, the fog node was reconstructed as a sanitizer to randomly transfer encrypted energy states and DR strategies with homomorphic operations. Moreover, a simulated annealing-based consensus algorithm was presented to examine the validity of the energy states and DR strategies.

An efficient and incentive mechanism is missing to motivate the Edge and micro Cloud resource providers to join and constitute a more generalized and decentralized ecosystem. To address this issue, we propose ALLSTAR, a blockchain based architecture for equally combining all the Cloud and Edge resources to be seamlessly leveraged by the application in the DevOps (development and operations) lifecycle. The ALLSTAR architecture is a systematic solution to realize the Cloud+Edge management and contributes to constructing the corresponding ALLSTAR ecosystem. This paper describes the overall architecture of ALLSTAR, the related key techniques, and detailed application DevOps processes as well as the new business model."

Enhanced security, decentralization and reliability are some of the advantages of blockchain technology that represent beneficial integration possibilities for computing and storage infrastructures. Fog computing is one of the recently emerged paradigms that needs to be improved to serve Internet of Things (IoT) environments of the future. In this paper we propose PF-BVM, a Privacy-aware Fogenhanced Blockchain Validation Mechanism, that aims to support the integration of IoT, Fog Computing, and the blockchain technology. In this model the more trusted a fog node is, the higher the authority granted to validate a block on behalf of the blockchain nodes. To guarantee the privacy-awareness in PF-BVM, we use a blockchain-based PKI architecture that is able to provide higher anonymity levels, while maintaining the decentralization property of a blockchain system. We also propose a concept for measuring reliability levels of blockchain systems. We validated our proposed approach in terms of execution time and energy consumption in a simulated environment. We compared PF-BVM to the currently used validation mechanism in the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm, and found that PF-BVM can effectively reduce the total validation time and total energy consumption of an IoT-Fog-Blockchain system."

This calls for a multidisciplinary approach and a re-imagining of how we create, deliver and consume network resources, data and services. This development will change the traditional business models and ecosystem roles, as well as open the market for new stakeholders like micro-operators, edge cloud operators and resource brokers. This paper discusses unprecedented challenges of enabling and stimulating multiple stakeholders to have a more active participation in the future 6G ecosystem and gives a brief outline of key implications of blockchain technologies for related business model transformations. The research extends the existing archetypes of closed and supply focused mobile broadband business models and proposes the novel open ecosystem-focused scenario in which value configuration is leveraging distributed ledger technologies. This expands the architecture from centralized innovation and transaction platforms towards decentralization without a focal resource-orchestrating entity. Results showed that blockchain enabled 6G business can be built on novel business opportunities, value generation and competitive advantage that have positive strategic consequences on scalability, replicability and sustainability."

BSM are lightweight messages that can be regularly broadcast by the vehicles to enable a variety of applications. On the other hand, event-driven message (EDM) are messages generated at the time of occurrence such as accidents or roads sliding and can contain much more heavy elements including pictures, audio or videos. Security, architecture and communication solutions for BSM use cases have been largely documented on in the literature contrary to EDM due to several concerns such as the variant size of EDM, the appropriate architecture along with latency, privacy and security. In this paper, we propose a secure and blockchain based EDM protocol for 5G enabled vehicular edge computing. To offer scalability and latency for the proposed scenario, we adopt a 5G cellular architecture due to its projected features compared to 4G tong-term evaluation (LTE) for vehicular communications. We consider edge computing to provide local processing of EDM that can improve the response time of public agencies (ambulances or rescue teams) that may intervene to the scene. We make use of lightweight multi-receiver signcryption scheme without pairing that offers low time consuming operations, security, privacy and access control. EDM records need to be kept into a distributed system which can guarantee reliability and auditability of EDM. To achieve this, we construct a private blockchain based on the edge nodes to store EDM records. The performance analysis of the proposed protocol confirms its efficiency."

This security confirmation is critical as a large number of users are offered services in Fog Computing. To address this challenge, in this paper, we first propose an efficient mutual authentication method between Clouds-Fogs Edges. The solution enables authentication between edge users and the Fog servers that newly enter the system. The method makes the Fog servers to store one secret key per user and the user performs hash-based encryptions/decryptions. The proposed system is supported by Blockchain technique to achieve data integrity when confidential data are transferred between edge devices and nodes. The transactions between the nodes are recorded in the blocks which are hashed so that all edge and fog nodes are encircled by a secured system. Whenever any malicious edge server enters the network, it is identified based on ledger maintained at the nodes. The security and performance analysis shows the scheme is applicable for the Fog computing environment."

The mining process of Blockchain, however, incurs a heavy computational workload for miners to solve the proof-of-work puzzle (i.e., a series of the hashing computation), which is prohibitive from the perspective of the mobile terminals (MTs). The advanced multi-access mobile edge computing (MEC), which enables the MTs to offload part of the computational workloads (for solving the proof-of-work) to the nearby edge-servers (ESs), provides a promising approach to address this issue. By offloading the computational workloads via multi-access MEC, the MTs can effectively increase their successful probabilities when participating in the mining game and gain the consequent reward (i.e., winning the bitcoin). However, as a compensation to the ESs which provide the computational resources to the MTs, the MTs need to pay the ESs for the corresponding resource-acquisition costs. Thus, to investigate the trade-off between obtaining the computational resources from the ESs (for solving the proof-of-work) and paying for the consequent cost, we formulate an optimization problem in which the MTs determine their acquired computational resources from different ESs, with the objective of maximizing the MTs' social net-reward in the mining process while keeping the fairness among the MTs. In spite of the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we exploit its layered structure and propose efficient distributed algorithms for the MTs to individually determine their optimal computational resources acquired from different ESs. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and the performance of our proposed multi-access MEC for Blockchain."

Within the IoT, there is a growing number of peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, increasing the exposure to security vulnerabilities, and the risk of cyberattacks. Blockchain technology has been explored as middleware in P2P transactions, but existing solutions have mainly focused on providing a safe environment for data trade without considering potential changes in interaction topologies. we present EdgeBoT, a proof-of-concept smart contracts based platform for the IoT built on top of the ethereum blockchain. With the Blockchain of Things (BoT) at the edge of the network, EdgeBoT enables a wider variety of interaction topologies between nodes in the network and external services while guaranteeing ownership of data and end users' privacy. in EdgeBoT, edge devices trade their data directly with third parties and without the need of intermediaries. This opens the door to new interaction modalities, in which data producers at the edge grant access to batches of their data to different third parties. Leveraging the immutability properties of blockchains, together with the distributed nature of smart contracts, data owners can audit and are aware of all transactions that have occurred with their data. we report initial results demonstrating the potential of EdgeBoT within the IoT. we show that integrating our solutions on top of existing IoT systems has a relatively small footprint in terms of computational resource usage, but a significant impact on the protection of data ownership and management of data trade."

Sharding appears to be a promising solution to scale out the blockchain system horizontally by dividing the entire network into multiple shards or clusters.

Such mechanisms offer a solution to specific application scenarios such as microgrids and other edge-based applications where clusters of autonomous systems potentially require structure reconfigurations. The proposed mechanisms offer three-stage procedures to merge and split multiple clusters. Based on our simulation experiments, we show that the proposed merging and splitting operations based on proof of work (PoW) consensus algorithm can be optimized to reduce the merging time considerably (in the magnitude of 1/22000 based on 100 blocks) which effectively reduces overall merging and splitting completion time, interruption time and required computation power."

Topology information and access rules are stored and queried in a completely distributed manner, ensuring data availability even in case a centralized controller is temporarily down or the network partitioned. Moreover, blockchain consensus algorithms foster a participative validation of topology information, to ensure the identity of interacting machines/nodes, to securely distribute topology information and commands in a privacy-preserving manner, and to trace any past modification in a nonrepudiable manner. Finally, the adoption of configurable edge gateways allows to take prompt countermeasures in case potential threats are identified, by activating access rules stored in ledgers in a secure and distributed manner.

Because the IoT can make anything in anyplace be connected together at any time, it can provide ubiquitous services. With the establishment and use of 5G wireless networks, the cellular IoT (CIoT) will be developed and applied. In order to provide more reliable CIoT applications, a reliable network topology is very important. Reaching a consensus is one of the most important issues in providing a highly reliable CIoT design. Therefore, it is necessary to reach a consensus so that even if some components in the system is abnormal, the application in the system can still execute correctly in CIoT. In this study, a protocol of consensus is discussed in CIoT with dual abnormality mode that combines dormant abnormality and malicious abnormality. The protocol proposed in this research not only allows all normal components in CIoT to reach a consensus with the minimum times of data exchange, but also allows the maximum number of dormant and malicious abnormal components in CIoT. In the meantime, the protocol can make all normal components in CIoT satisfy the constraints of reaching consensus: Termination, Agreement, and Integrity."

In this fog computing, a vast amount of data generated from the Internet of Things is transmitted to the cloud system located at a remote place, and is processed by a fog computer such as a sensor or a router located nearby, so that only the necessary data is transmitted to the cloud system. However, the above-mentioned fog computer has some drawbacks like being shut down due to an attack by a malicious user in advance, and a method of processing when a fog computer is down or restored. In this paper we describe a fog computing with blockchain that enables fog computers to share transaction generated by processing transaction information of a device controlled by a blockchain method to a security and device control method of a fog computer utilizing the technology.

Due to these conditions, diabetes patients have traditionally checked blood glucose levels through Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) techniques, like pricking their fingers multiple times per day. Such techniques involve a number of drawbacks that can be solved by using a device called Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM), which can measure blood glucose levels continuously throughout the day without having to prick the patient when carrying out every measurement. This article details the design and implementation of a system that enhances commercial CGMs by adding Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities to them that allow for monitoring patients remotely and, thus, warning them about potentially dangerous situations. The proposed system makes use of smartphones to collect blood glucose values from CGMs and then sends them either to a remote cloud or to distributed fog computing nodes. Moreover, in order to exchange reliable, trustworthy and cybersecure data with medical scientists, doctors and caretakers, the system includes the deployment of a decentralized storage system that receives, processes and stores the collected data. Furthermore, in order to motivate users to add new data to the system, an incentive system based on a digital cryptocurrency named GlucoCoin was devised. Such a system makes use of a blockchain that is able to execute smart contracts in order to automate CGM sensor purchases or to reward the users that contribute to the system by providing their own data. Thanks to all the previously mentioned technologies, the proposed system enables patient data crowdsourcing and the development of novel mobile health (mHealth) applications for diagnosing, monitoring, studying and taking public health actions that can help to advance in the control of the disease and raise global awareness on the increasing prevalence of diabetes."

People prefer outsourcing their confidential data for storage and processing in cloud computing because of the auspicious services provided by cloud service providers. As promising as this paradigm is, it creates issues, including everything from data security to time latency with data computation and delivery to end-users. In response to these challenges, the fog computing paradigm was proposed as an extension of cloud computing to overcome the time latency and communication overhead and to bring computing and storage resources close to both the ground and the end-users. However, fog computing inherits the same security and privacy challenges encountered by traditional cloud computing. This paper proposed a fine-grained data access control approach by integrating the ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) algorithm and blockchain technology to secure end-users' data security against rogue fog nodes in case a compromised fog node is ousted. In this approach, we proposed federations of fog nodes that share the same attributes, such as services and locations. The fog federation concept minimizes the time latency and communication overhead between fog nodes and cloud servers. Furthermore, the blockchain idea and the CP-ABE algorithm integration allow for fog nodes within the same fog federation to conduct a distributed authorization process. Besides that, to address time latency and communication overhead issues, we equip each fog node with an off-chain database to store the most frequently accessed data files for a particular time, as well as an on-chain access control policies table (on-chain files tracking table) that must be protected from tampering by rogue fog nodes. As a result, the blockchain plays a critical role here because it is tamper-proof by nature. We assess our approach's efficiency and feasibility by conducting a simulation and analyzing its security and performance."

To enable auditable and delay-sensitive IoT services, these knowledge will be shared among decentralized intelligent network edges (DINEs), end users, and supervisors frequently. Blockchain has a promising ability to provide a traceable, privacy-preserving and tamper-resistant ledger for sharing edge knowledge. However, due to the complicated environments of network edges, knowledge sharing among DINEs still faces many challenges. Firstly, the resource limitation and mobility of DINEs impede the applicability of existing consensus tricks (e.g., Poof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Paxos) of blockchain. Secondly, the adversaries may eavesdrop the content of edge knowledge or entice the blockchain to forks using some attacking models (like man-in-the-middle attack, denial of services, etc.). In this article, an user-centric blockchain (UCB) framework is proposed for preserving edge knowledge sharing in IoT. Significant superiorities of UCB benefit from the proof of popularity (PoP) consensus mechanism, which is more energy-efficient and fast.

One of the major applications of IoT is the SG and smart meter which consists of a large number of internet-connected sensors and can communicate bi-directionally in real-time. The SG network involves smart meters, data collectors, generators, and sensors connected with the internet. SG networks involve the generation, distribution, transmission, and consumption of electrical power supplies. It consists of Household Area Network (HAN), and Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) for communication. Smart meters can communicate bidirectionally with consumers and provide real-time information to utility offices. But this communication channel is a wide-open network for data transmission. Therefore, it makes the SG network and smart meter vulnerable to outside hacker and various Cyber-Physical System (CPS) attacks such as False Data Injection (FDI), inserting malicious data, erroneous data, manipulating the sensor reading values. Here cryptography techniques can play a major role along with the private blockchain model for secure data transmission in smart meters.

In this network, mobile users associate with the serving base stations (BSs) and offload their computation-intensive proof-of-work mining tasks to the mobile edge computing server of the macro-cell BS. We initialize the user association strategy by using the traditional nearest BS association algorithm in the blockchain-enabled HetNet. Then, we formulate the computation offloading problem and design an alternating iterative algorithm to attain the computing demand strategies for all users. Based on obtained computing demand strategies, we propose a modified user association algorithm in order to improve the data congestion of BSs. Analytical results show that the blockchain-enabled HetNet can serve more users, and the proposed algorithms can effectively obtain strategies of user association and computation offloading. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed alternating iterative algorithm for computation offloading has fast convergence and good stability, and the proposed modified user association algorithm can avoid data congestion better than the traditional nearest BS association algorithm."

A reputation-based consensus protocol is devised to adapt the weakly connected environment with improved consensus efficiency and promoted UAVs' honest behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce a novel vehicular fog computing based off-chain mechanism by leveraging ground vehicles as moving fog nodes to offload LAYs' heavy data processing and storage tasks. To optimally stimulate vehicles to share their idle computing resources, we also design a two-layer reinforcement learning based incentive algorithm for UAVs and ground vehicles in the highly dynamic networks.

For this, smart vehicles need to deal with various types of data for safety and infotainment, such as real-time traffic, multi-media contents, documents and weather information. Recently, a fleet of vehicles connected to other vehicles and infrastructure (i.e., road side units) using a legacy or 5G mmWave spectrum has been considered as a platform to cooperate for those new tasks, known as the vehicular cloud or fog. Within the vehicular cloud, data management should consider security, high availability and interoperability between vehicles. However, these are not easily achievable without a centralized service provider; it is difficult for an autonomous P2P system to guarantee data integrity, and it cannot compensate drivers that actively participate in the vehicular cloud. Fortunately, the many successes achieved in the field of crypto-currency raise the possibility of defining incentives that are necessary for a sustainable digital economy.

This scenario leads to unprecedented scalability and security challenges, with one of the first areas for these applications being Smart Cities (SC). IoT devices in new network paradigms, such as Edge Computing and Fog Computing, will collect data from urban environments, providing real-time management information. One of these challenges is ensuring that the data sent from Edge Computing are reliable. Blockchain has been a technology that has gained the spotlight in recent years, due to its robust security in fintech and cryptocurrencies. Its strong encryption and distributed and decentralized network make it potential for this challenge. Using Blockchain with IoT makes it possible for SC applications to have security information distributed, which makes it possible to shield against Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS). IoT devices in an SC can have a long life, which increases the chance of having security holes caused by outdated firmware. Adding a layer of identification and verification of attributes and signature of messages coming from IoT devices by Smart Contracts can bring confidence in the content. SC Apps that extract data from legacy and outdated appliances, installed in inaccessible, unknown, and often untrusted urban environments can benefit from this work. Our work's main contribution is the development of API Gateways to be used in IoT devices and network gateway to sign, identify, and authorize messages.

As such, the computation-intensive tasks of the miners can be either computed locally or offloaded to some certain MEC servers to fully exploit the computation resources. Moreover, to decrease the energy consumption of the IoT networks, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the energy efficiency of IoT devices by jointly optimizing the computation mode selection and power allocation. Since the formulated problem is generally intractable with mixed-integer variables, an Fmincon-based algorithm is proposed, which guarantees a globally optimal solution.

While the waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) directive's contemporary focus is on handling the product as waste after its end of life, the circular economy focuses on retaining the product's value with a restorative system. The polluter-pays principle requires producers of pollution to bear the costs of handling the pollution, leading to the extended producer responsibility (EPR) principle. This requires manufacturers to change their focus from their current passive role of out-sourcing end-of-life treatment to taking explicit responsibility for product management over an extended period of time. This paper investigates how a manufacturer can assume its responsibility to achieve circularity for its products. Based on our findings, three fundamental circularity principles, the circular electric and electronic equipment (CEEE) principles, for manufactures of electronic and electrical equipment are defined: (1) Serialize product identifiers, (2) data controlled by their authoritative source at the edge, and (3) independent actors' access to edge data via a distributer ledger are the foundation of the Edge and Distributed Ledger (Edge&DL) model.

Access control contracts provide access control methods for different users and enable static access verification and dynamic access verification by checking the user's properties and history behavior. Register contract contains user property information, edge computing node information, the access control and history smart contract information, and provides functions such as registration, update, and deletion. History contract records the historical behavior information of malicious users, receives the report information of malicious requestors from the access control contract, implements a misbehavior check method to determines whether the requestor has misbehavior, and returns the corresponding result. Finally, we design decentralized system architecture, prove the security properties, and analysis to verify the feasibility of the system. Results demonstrate that our method can effectively improve the timeliness of data, reduce network latency, and ensure the security, reliability, and traceability of data."

In some scenarios, however, a central server for aggregating the partial learning results is not available. In fully decentralized learning, a network of peer-to-peer nodes collaborates to form a consensus on a global model without a trusted aggregating party. Often, the network consists of Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge computing nodes. Previous approaches for decentralized learning map the gradient batching and averaging algorithm from traditional federated learning to blockchain architectures. In an open network of participating nodes, the threat of adversarial nodes introducing poisoned models into the network increases compared to a federated learning scenario which is controlled by a single authority. Hence, the decentralized architecture must additionally include a machine learning-aware fault tolerance mechanism to address the increased attack surface. We propose a tangle architecture for decentralized learning, where the validity of model updates is checked as part of the basic consensus. We provide an experimental evaluation of the proposed architecture, showing that it performs well in both model convergence and model poisoning protection."

In a cellular network for healthcare applications, we must consider the different priorities of data transmission and computation by referring to the emergency levels of patients. A critical issue of determining the allocation of wireless resources among users is the authenticity of their priorities (i.e., emergency levels). Without authenticating the users' priorities, a user who advocates a higher emergency level can allocate more wireless resources, leading to the insufficient wireless resources to the users who are actually in high priorities. In this paper, we investigate the optimization of end-to-end delay of wireless users in a cellular network with the authenticity of their priorities by blockchain consensus and propose an algorithm of allocating communication and computation resources to minimize the delay of data transmission and computation. The numerical results illustrate that our proposed algorithm is capable of dramatically reducing the end-to-end delay under the various scenarios of healthcare applications."

An SIoT system has to store and manage device reputation values, which are used by end devices to determine the trustworthiness of another one. This device trustworthiness can also be affected by its geographical location. In this work, we introduced an architecture that includes the geospatial context in the part concerned with reputation management. The proposed architecture is based on the cloud-fog-edge architecture and uses the fog layer as the management system. The devices in the fog layer form an Ethereum Blockchain network and store the Smart Contracts. These in turn allow the management functionalities to be carried out in a decentralised, transparent and secure way, which are the advantages of Blockchain. To enable the characteristics with a geospatial component, it is necessary to apply a geocoding technique. This work shows how geocoding techniques can be adapted to cover the main geospatial functionalities and compares two geocoding options (Geohash or S2).

Elipmoc is an evolution of Gigahorse, the top research decompiler, dramatically improving over it and over other state-of-the-art tools, by employing several high-precision techniques and making them scalable. Among these techniques are a new kind of context sensitivity (termed transactional sensitivity) that provides a more effective static abstraction of distinct dynamic executions; a path-sensitive (yet scalable, through path merging) algorithm for inference of function arguments and returns; and a fully context sensitive private function reconstruction process. As a result, smart contract security analyses and reverse-engineering tools built on top of Elipmoc achieve high scalability, precision and completeness. Elipmoc improves over all notable past decompilers, including its predecessor, Gigahorse, and the stateof-the-art industrial tool, Panoramix, integrated into the primary Ethereum blockchain explorer, Etherscan. Elipmoc produces decompiled contracts with fully resolved operands at a rate of 99.5% (compared to 62.8% for Gigahorse), and achieves much higher completeness in code decornpilation than Panoramix-e.g., up to 67% more coverage of external call statements-while being over 5x faster.

Moreover, cloud service providers are continuously extending their capacity to reach more industries and address their concerns. For example, Amazon has recently launched a pay-as-you-go cloud computing service that will take place on satellite operators to provide more IoT services to industries such as the agricultural and shipping industries.

To meet this challenge, we propose a mobile edge computing (MEC) based blockchain network where multi-mobile users (MUs) act as miners to offload their data processing tasks and mining tasks to a nearby MEC server via wireless channels. Specially, we formulate task offloading, user privacy preservation and mining profit as a joint optimization problem which is modelled as a Markov decision process, where our objective is to minimize the long-term system offloading utility and maximize the privacy levels for all blockchain users. We first propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based offloading scheme which enables MUs to make optimal offloading decisions based on blockchain transaction states, wireless channel qualities between MUs and MEC server and user's power hash states. To further improve the offloading performances for larger-scale blockchain scenarios, we then develop a deep RL algorithm by using deep Q-network which can efficiently solve large state space without any prior knowledge of the system dynamics. Experiment and simulation results show that the proposed RL-based offloading schemes significantly enhance user privacy, and reduce the energy consumption as well as computation latency with minimum offloading costs in comparison with the benchmark offloading schemes."

However, most existing researches focus on the integration of public blockchain and IoTs. In fact, problems such as slow consensus, low transmission throughput, and completely open storage on the public blockchain are intolerable in IoT scenarios. Although consortium blockchain represented by Hyperledger Fabric has improved the transmission rate, its data security completely relies on the PKI-based certificate mechanism, resulting in transmission inefficiency and privacy leakage. In this paper, a key-derived Controllable Lightweight Secure Certificateless Signature (CLS2) algorithm is proposed to significantly improve the transmission efficiency and keep similar computation overhead of consortium blockchain. Compared with the existing certificateless signatures, CLS2 achieves more secure transactions, whose controllable anonymity and key-derived mechanism not only prevents public key replacement attacks and forged signature attacks, but also supports hierarchical privacy protection. Armed with CLS2, we design a consortium blockchain security architecture based on Hyperledger Fabric and edge computing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of certificateless signature in consortium blockchain. We formally prove the security of our schemes in the random oracle model. Specifically, the security of the proposed scheme is reduced to the Elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). Security analysis and experiments in IoT scenarios verify the feasibility and effectiveness of CLS2."

Auction is a classical algorithm which guarantees that the computing resources are allocated to the buyers of the computing resource. However, the traditional auction algorithm only guarantees the revenue gains for the sellers of the computing resource. How to guarantee the seller and the buyer of the computing resource when both are willing to trade and moreover, bid truthfully, is still an open problem in computing resource trading for edge-cloud-assisted IoT. In this paper, we introduce a broker with sparse information to manage and adjust the trading market. We then propose an iterative double-sided auction scheme for computing resource trading, where the broker solves an allocation problem to determine how much computing resource is traded and designs a specific price rule to induce the buyers and sellers of the computing resource to submit bids in a truthful way. Thus, hidden information can be extracted gradually to obtain optimal computing resource allocation and trading prices. Hence, the proposed algorithm can achieve the maximum social welfare meanwhile protecting the privacies of the buyers and the sellers. Our theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is efficient, i.e., it achieves the maximum social welfare. In addition, the proposed algorithm can provide effective trading strategies for the buyers and sellers of the computing resource, leading to the proposed algorithm satisfying incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and budget balance."

On one hand, IoT devices are weak and need external assistance. Edge computing provides a promising direction addressing the deficiency of centralized cloud computing in scaling massive number of devices. On the other hand, IoT devices are also relatively vulnerable facing malicious hackers due to resource constraints. The emerging blockchain and smart contracts technologies bring a series of new security features for IoT and edge computing. In this paper, to address the challenges, we design and prototype an edge-IoT framework named EdgeChain based on blockchain and smart contracts. The core idea is to integrate a permissioned blockchain and the internal currency or coin system to link the edge cloud resource pool with each IoT device' account and resource usage, and hence behavior of the IoT devices. EdgeChain uses a credit-based resource management system to control how much resource IoT devices can obtain from edge servers, based on predefined rules on priority, application types, and past behaviors. Smart contracts are used to enforce the rules and policies to regulate the IoT device behavior in a nondeniable and automated manner. All the IoT activities and transactions are recorded into blockchain for secure data logging and auditing. We implement an EdgeChain prototype and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the ideas. The results show that while gaining the security benefits of blockchain and smart contracts, the cost of integrating them into EdgeChain is within a reasonable and acceptable range."

The edge devices in a CPS are able to calculate a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) from local observation for one or more events via a consensus approach to iteratively optimize the consensus LLRs for the whole CPS system. The information-exchange topologies are considered as a collection of jointly connected networks and an iterative distributed consensus algorithm is proposed to optimize the LLRs to form a global optimal decision. Each active device in the CPS first detects the local region and obtains a local LLR, which then exchanges with its active neighbors. Compressed data collection is enforced by a reliable cluster partitioning scheme, which conserves sensing energy and prolongs network lifetime. Then the LLR estimations are improved iteratively until a global optimum is reached. The proposed distributed consensus algorithm can converge fast and hence improve the reliability with lower transmission burden and computation costs in CPS. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

With the help of edge computing, the data transfer rate has been increased drastically within a limited bandwidth.

On the other hand, the distributed nature of the edge computing paradigm introduces security and privacy concerns (e.g., data theft).

An established DNN model provides useful analysis results that can improve the operation of IoT systems in turn. The progress in distributed/federated DNN training further unleashes the potential of integration of IoT and intelligence applications. When a large number of IoT devices are deployed in different physical locations, distributed training allows training modules to be deployed to multiple edge data centers that are close to the IoT devices to reduce the latency and movement of large amounts of data. In practice, these IoT devices and edge data centers are usually owned and managed by different parties, who do not fully trust each other or have conflicting interests. It is hard to coordinate them to provide end-to-end integrity protection of the DNN construction and application with classical security enhancement tools. For example, one party may share an incomplete data set with others, or contribute a modified sub DNN model to manipulate the aggregated model and affect the decision-making process. To mitigate this risk, we propose a novel blockchain based end-to-end integrity protection scheme for DNN applications integrated with an IoT system in the edge computing environment. The protection system leverages a set of cryptography primitives to build a blockchain adapted for edge computing that is scalable to handle a large number of IoT devices.

However, the traditional prediction market is centralized, which means the platform is completely controlled by just one person or team. This centralization has bad influence on the platform to obtaining trust from massive users. So it is important for the prediction market industry to decentralize the traditional platform into a decentralized one, and get its control from few person and give it back to a lot of people in the prediction market community. Blockchain is a very promising technology to make it true as it is a popular decentralizing technology. However, existing blockchain technologies like Bitcoin or Ethernum bring about new problems like high energy consumption, expensive fee, and very low system capacity, which is not suitable for the current prediction market. To solve these problems, we propose to combine masternode technology together with blockchain to serve as a decentralized node, and each masternode is deployed and running on an edge server in mobile edge network. The network of masternodes serves together as the decentralized prediction market platform. As we know, it is not easy to run a masternode. So the number of mastemodes is much less than the number of complete nodes of the blockchain. As a result, it is easier to reach the consensus among these mastemodes.

However, the increased attack surface offered by the growing number of connected vulnerable devices and separation of SDN control and data planes could overturn the huge benefits of such a system. This article addresses the vulnerability of the trust relationship between the control and data planes. To meet this aim, we propose an edge computing-based Blockchain as a Service (BaaS), enabled by an external BaaS provider. The proposed solution provides verification of inserted flows through an efficient, edge-distributed, blockchain solution. We study two scenarios for the blockchain reward purpose: 1) information symmetry, in which the SDN operator has direct knowledge of the real effort spent by the BaaS provider and 2) information asymmetry, in which the BaaS provider controls the exposure of information regarding spent effort. The latter yields the so-called moral hazard, where the BaaS may claim higher than actual effort. We develop a novel mathematical model of the edge BaaS solution and propose an innovative algorithm of a fair reward scheme based on game theory that takes into account moral hazard. We evaluate the viability of our solution through analytical simulations. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed algorithm to maximize the joint profits of the BaaS and SDN operator, i.e., maximizing the social welfare."

To address this problem, we propose a cross-domain data sharing mechanism named MicrothingsChain, which allows the exchange and reuse of data among various applications in a collaborative way. This paradigm calls for novel security and access control mechanisms to enable resource-limited smart objects to verify a claimed access right without relying on central authorization systems. In this paper, we present a novel smart contract-based cross-domain authentication and access control mechanism for applicationcentric IoT. Specially, we propose a proof-of-edge computing node consensus protocol to avoid centralization in practice.

In this paper, we propose a decentralized system for medical data management, to address the challenge of data privacy protection during data sharing between network nodes, leveraging the blockchain technology. We propose protocols to achieve this and normalize data format recorded on the blockchain. The entities of our system include users, contributing data; edge data hub (EDH) nodes, used for storing users' data (an EDH stores one user's data and is controlled by the corresponding user); service nodes, with the ability to analyze user data and customers that need the analysis of the data. To protect data privacy in the EDH, we use a secure computing platform (SCP) to process data. Furthermore, data request from a service with high credibility is more likely to be permitted by the EDH. Data authenticity is guaranteed by checking the hash value recorded on the blockchain. Moreover, we reduce the off-blockchain storage space leveraging the data sparsity. Our system thus enables data sharing, authenticity, privacy protection and storage space reduction, shedding lights on building a developable and secure data-driven world."

We propose an adaptive context-aware anomaly detection method that is optimized to run on a fog computing platform. In this approach, we devise a novel sensor association algorithm that generates fingerprints of sensors, clusters them, and extracts the context of the system. Based on the contextual information, our predictor model, which comprises an Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and Gaussian estimator, detects anomalies, and a consensus algorithm identifies the source of the anomaly.

Critical industries are essential to the foundation of today's society, and interruption of service in any of these sectors can reverberate through other sectors and even around the globe.

To defend against these possible attacks, numerous cryptography-based authentication schemes have been proposed for the smart grid. Most of the schemes investigate the secret key distribution problem, but the requirement of decentralized registration authority is neglected. In addition, over-complicated cryptographic primitives also strengthen the burden of authentication system. In contrast with previous researches, our proposed BlockSLAP utilizes cutting-edge blockchain technology as well as smart contract to decentralize the registration authority and reduce the interaction process to 2 steps. Moreover, our protocol is proved secure under computational hard assumption and informal security analysis. Finally, experimental results show that smart grid authentication performance in our protocol has been improved compared to the other existing ECC-related schemes."

Edge service providers are introduced along with ordinary nodes to efficiently manage service provisioning. The edge service providers are placed in the neighborhood of the ordinary nodes to ensure smooth communication between them. The huge amount of data generated by smart vehicles is stored in a distributed file storage system, known as Interplanetary File System (IPFS). It is used to tackle the issues related to data storage in centralized architectures, such as data tampering, lack of privacy, vulnerability to hackers, etc. Monetary incentives are given to edge vehicle nodes to motivate them for accurate and timely service provisioning to ordinary nodes. In response, ordinary nodes give reviews to the edge nodes against the services provided by them, which are further stored in a blockchain to ensure integrity, security and transparency. Smart contracts are used to automate the system processes without the inclusion of an intermediate party and to check the reviews given to the edge nodes. To optimize gas consumption and to enhance the system performance, a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism is used to validate the transactions. Moreover, a caching system is introduced at the edge nodes to store frequently used services. Furthermore, both security and privacy are enhanced in the proposed system by incorporating a symmetric key cryptographic mechanism. A trust management mechanism is also proposed in this work to calculate the nodes' reputation values based upon their trust values. These values determine the authenticity of the nodes involved in the network. Eventually, it is concluded from the simulation results that the proposed system is efficient for VNs."

To meet the time-varying service demands of a typical user, a cooperative service caching strategy in the unit of the base station (BS) cluster is proposed. We formulate the caching problem as a time-averaged completion delay minimization problem and transform it into time-decoupled instantaneous problems with a virtual caching cost queue at first.

The simulations validate that the proposed online distributed service caching algorithm can achieve the optimal time-averaged completion delay of offloading tasks with the smallest caching cost in the unit of a BS cluster."

Blockchain has been attracting great interest recently because it provides a way to reach consensus in decentralized systems. However, existing blockchain systems assume high communication capabilities for vehicles, which is difficult to achieve in a decentralized vehicular environment. Existing studies also assume the existence of networking infrastructure, such as roadside units (RSU). In this paper, we propose a scheme to empower blockchain in vehicular environments without depending on the existing networking infrastructure. The proposed scheme uses a distributed clustering approach to select some vehicles as edge nodes, and the edge nodes maintain the blockchain used to record transactions in a decentralized way. The proposed scheme employs a distributed approach that guides vehicle clustering with the consideration of multiple metrics based on a fuzzy logic algorithm. By using the edge nodes, the proposed scheme solves the communication problem of maintaining a blockchain in a totally decentralized vehicular environment.

Cellular networks of the future necessitate the formulation of efficient resource allocation schemes that readily meet throughput requirements. The idea of combining Device-to-Device (D2D), Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), and Network slicing (NS) can improve spectrum utilization with better performance and scalability. This work presents a spectrum efficiency optimization problem in D2D based 5G-Heterogeneous Cellular Network (5G-HCN) with NS. Owing to the shortage of resources, we propose an underlay model where macro-cell users (MUs), small-cell users (SUs), and D2D users (DUs) reuse the resources while considering the effects of interference. The goal is to maximize the average network spectrum efficiency (SE) and throughput without degrading the system performance. The problem at hand is naturally a non-convex mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem that is intractable. Therefore, we have suggested a distributed resource allocation strategy with an edge computing (DRA-EC) approach to find the sub-optimal solution. In distributed augmented Lagrange method, each edge router located at BS will solve its problem locally, and the consensus algorithm will find the global solution using these local estimates. The central slice controller will cut the customized network slices according to the bandwidth requirements of each user type with optimized spectrum information. The simulation outcomes prove that our proposed method is near the central optimization scheme with low computational complexity. It is much better because it reduces the computational time and system overhead."

Also, joint optimization on storage, computation, and communication is in need for multiaccess edge computing frameworks. The adaptive network control has been explored using deep reinforcement learning (RL), but it is not sufficient for bursty network traffic flows, especially when the network traffic pattern may change over time. We formulate the routing control in an environment with time-variant link delays as a Lyapunov optimization problem. We identify that there is a tradeoff between optimization performance and modeling accuracy when the propagation delays are included. We propose a novel deep RL (DRL)-based adaptive network routing method to tackle the issues mentioned above. A Lyapunov optimization technique is used to reduce the upper bound of the Lyapunov drift, improving queuing stability in networked systems. By modeling the network traffic pattern using the Markovian arrival process, we show that network routing problems can be modeled as Markov decision processes and value-iteration-based RL methods can be used to solve them. We design a blockchain-based protocol using proof of elapsed time consensus mechanism to ensure a trustworthy network statistics information exchange for the routing framework. Experiment results show that the proposed method can learn a routing policy and adapt to the changing environment. The proposed method outperforms the baseline backpressure method in multiple settings and converges faster than existing methods. Moreover, the DRL module can effectively learn a better estimation of the long-term Lyapunov drift and penalty functions, providing superior results in terms of the backlog size, end-to-end latency, age of information, and throughput. Furthermore, the blockchain-based network statistics exchange can provide the routing framework against malicious nodes. In addition, the proposed model performs well under various topologies, and thus can be used in general cases."

For this reason, one of the critical challenges of having numerous IoT devices is the capacity to manage them and their data. A specific concern is from which devices or Edge clouds to accept join requests or interaction requests.

Blockchain have become popular for its benefits, including decentralization, persistence, immutability, auditability, and consensus. Great attention has been received by the IoT based on the construction of distributed file systems worldwide. A new generation of IoT-based distributed file systems has been proposed with the integration of Blockchain technology, such as the Swarm and Interplanetary File System. By using IoT, new technical challenges, such as Credibility, Harmonization, large-volume data, heterogeneity, and constrained resources are arising. To ensure data security in IoT, centralized access control technologies do not provide credibility. In this work, we propose an attribute-based access control model for the IoT. The access control lists are not required for each device by the system. It enhances access management in terms of effectiveness. Moreover, we use blockchain technology for recording the attribute, avoiding data tempering, and eliminating a single point of failure at edge computing devices. IoT devices control the user's environment as well as his or her private data collection; therefore, the exposure of the user's personal data to non-trusted private and public servers may result in privacy leakage. To automate the system, smart contracts are used for data accessing, whereas Proof of Authority is used for enhancing the system's performance and optimizing gas consumption. Through smart contracts, ciphertext can be stored on a blockchain by the data owner. Data can only be decrypted in a valid access period, whereas in blockchains, the trace function is achieved by the storage of invocation and the creation of smart contracts. Scalability issues can also be resolved by using the multichain blockchain. Eventually, it is concluded from the simulation results that the proposed system is efficient for IoT."

At the same time, the limited computing power and available energy consumption of IoT terminal devices are also the important bottlenecks that would restrict the application of blockchain, but edge computing could solve this problem. The emergence of edge computing can effectively reduce the delay of data transmission and improve data processing capacity. However, user data in edge computing is usually stored and processed in some honest-but-curious authorized entities, which leads to the leakage of users' privacy information. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a location data collection method that satisfies the local differential privacy to protect users' privacy. In this paper, a Voronoi diagram constructed by the Delaunay method is used to divide the road network space and determine the Voronoi grid region where the edge nodes are located. A random disturbance mechanism that satisfies the local differential privacy is utilized to disturb the original location data in each Voronoi grid. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed privacy-preserving mechanism is verified through comparison experiments. Compared with the existing privacy-preserving methods, the proposed privacy-preserving mechanism can not only better meet users' privacy needs, but also have higher data availability."

Training such huge data volumes using a centralized data center proves to be a challenging task, due to prohibitively heavy bandwidth costs, poor time efficiency, and high privacy leakages. These challenges have fueled the revolutionary shift of intelligence applications from a centralized data center to ubiquitous edges, denoted as edge intelligence. However, there is still a long way ahead before edge intelligence is able to fully mature. Governing and sharing the use of learning results efficiently, reliably, and safely are hampered by the heterogeneity and non-confidence among edges. in this article, we propose blockchain energized edge intelligence for B5G networks, called the Ai-Chain, fusing deep learning and blockchain. The Ai-Chain is a distributed and immutable record of learning results that is able to construct a new basis of sharing among edges. Additionally, we consider a novel learning-based consensus protocol in the Ai-Chain, denoted as proof of learning (PoL). in response to the huge computing power waste, PoL treats the training process as a working puzzle, rather than the meaningless hashing in a proof of work protocol. On the other hand, PoL fully unlocks the potential of sharing more advanced intelligence among edges. in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Ai-Chain, we employ it to solve a joint resource allocation problem in B5G networks. Experimental results prove the superior performance of the Ai-Chain to the current popular scheme."

To mitigate such attacks in real-time, we propose an SDN architecture for resource constrained devices in a fog-enabled IoT environment using a private blockchain (pBC) network. We exploit the decentralized nature of pBC for enabling resource-constrained SDN controllers towards transparently setting flow rules for fog nodes and other devices in the network. In case the miners identify faulty flow rules, pBC allows the SDN devices/fog nodes to retract back to an earlier flow rule while raising a flag against the alleged controller. Additionally, since data in pBC are accessible by all the candidates having the same genesis file, they are readily available to malicious users. Towards this, we further propose encrypting the data before inserting them into the blocks, which helps in securing the data from undesired users. Through the extensive deployment of our proposed fusion, we observe CPU usage of 30% among the devices and latencies in the range of milliseconds, which presents the feasibility of our system with minimum delay. We also observe a reduction in energy consumption by more than 90%, compared to traditional SDN."

Except for information collection and communication, the RSUs also need to audit the data uploaded by vehicles, packing data as block transactions to guarantee high-quality data sharing.

MEPC is a technologically feasible and economically viable cloud for resource sharing, task scheduling, and autonomous traffic. Along with meeting the resource demand of burgeoning vehicular applications, MEPC can empower the traditional cloud-edge-end architecture based on current and developing technologies, such as AI and blockchain."

However, as the core of multi-SDN, reaching consensus among multiple SDN controllers is a thorny issue. To meet the required design principle, this article proposes a blockchain-enabled distributed SDIIoT to synchronize local views between distinct SDN controllers and finally reach the consensus of the global view. On the other hand, both the cryptographic operations of blockchain and the noncryptographic tasks have access to the same computational resource pool of mobile edge cloud (MEC). In order to optimize the system energy efficiency, we adaptively allocate computational resources and the batch size of the block by jointly considering the trust features of SDN controllers and the resource requirements of noncryptographic operations. To implement the truly distributed manner of blockchain, we describe our problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to solve it. In the simulation results, we compare three different protocols of blockchain and show the effectiveness of our scheme in each of them."

With the advent of Edge computing and IoT, a reliable orchestration of latency-sensitive SFCs is needed to compose and maintain them in geo-distributed cloud infrastructures. However, the optimal SFC composition in this case becomes the NP-hard integer multi-commodity-chain flow (MCCF) problem that has no known approximation guarantees. In this paper, we first outline our novel practical and near optimal SFC composition scheme which is based on our novel metapath composite variable approach, admits end-to-end network QoS constraints (e.g., latency) and reaches 99% optimality on average in seconds for practically sized geo-distributed cloud infrastructures. We then propose a novel metapath-based SFC maintenance algorithm that guarantees a distributed control plane consistency without use of expensive consensus protocols. Using trace-driven simulations comprising of challenging disaster-incident conditions, we show that our solution composes twice as many SFCs and uses similar to 10x less control messages than state-of-the-art methods. Finally, experimental evaluations of our SFC orchestration prototype deployed on a realistic cloud/edge computing testbed show significant speed-ups (up to 3.5x) for our case-study geo-distributed latency-sensitive object tracking pipeline w.r.t. its IP-based cloud computing alternative."

Existing IoT systems generally adopt lightweight security protocols that lead to compromise and privacy leakage. Edge computing enables better access control and privacy protection, furthermore, blockchain architecture has achieved a trusted store of value by open-source and distributed consensus mechanisms. To embrace these new paradigms, we propose a scheme that employs one-time association multitasking proofs for peer to local authentication (OTMP-P2L). The scheme chooses relevant nondeterministic polynomial (NP) problem tasks, and manages localized trust and anonymity by using smart devices such as phones and pads, thereby enabling IoT devices to autonomously perform consensus validation with an enhanced message authentication code. This nested code is a one-time zero-knowledge proof that comprises multiple logic verification arguments. To increase diversity and reduce the workload of each one, these arguments are chained by a method that establishes some of the inputs of the following task from the output of previous tasks.

Our contribution results from the theorem stating how the Laplacian spectrum of an undirected simple finite graph changes in the case of adding an arbitrary edge into this graph. We identify that the mixing parameter of Best Constant weights of a complete finite graph with an arbitrary order ensures the convergence in time-varying topologies without any reconfiguration of the edge weights.

(2) The delegate node replicating the blockchain data can lead to privacy information leak. (3) The delegate node is vulnerable to the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. To tackle these drawbacks, we consider to minimize the redundant of blockchain to make the IoT devices as the specialized blockchain nodes.

The local blockchain ledger records the IoT domain entities' attributes, policy files' digests, and access decisions. Meanwhile, we use the channel technology of HLF to realize cross-domain access and use the IBS to filter the legal access requests for each IoT domain to prevent DDoS attacks.

In the big data era, one of the most critical applications is multiparty learning or federated learning, which allows different parties to collaborate with each other to obtain better learning models without sharing their own data. However, there are several main concerns about the current multiparty learning systems. First, most existing systems are distributed and need a central server to coordinate the learning process. However, such a central server can easily become a single point of failure and may not be trustworthy. Second, although quite a few schemes have been proposed to study Byzantine attacks, a very common and challenging kind of attack in distributed systems, they generally consider the scenario of learning a global model. However, in fact, all parties in multiparty learning usually have their own local models. The learning methods and security issues, in this case, are not fully explored. In this article, we propose a novel blockchain-empowered decentralized secure multiparty learning system with heterogeneous local models called BEMA. Particularly, we consider two types of Byzantine attacks, and carefully design off-chain sample mining and on-chain mining  schemes to protect the security of the proposed system. We theoretically prove the system performance bound and resilience under Byzantine attacks. The simulation results show that the proposed system obtains comparable performance with that of conventional distributed systems, and bounded performance in the case of Byzantine attacks."

Especially for driverless cars, real-time map updating can provide high-precision map service to assist the navigation, which requires vehicles to actively upload the latest road conditions. However, due to the untrusted network environment, it is difficult for the real-time map updating server to evaluate the authenticity of the road information from the vehicles. In order to prevent malicious vehicles from deliberately spreading false information and protect the privacy of vehicles from tracking attacks, this paper proposes a trust-based real-time map updating scheme. In this scheme, the public key is used as the identifier of the vehicle for anonymous communication with conditional anonymity. In addition, the blockchain is applied to provide the existence proof for the public key certificate of the vehicle. At the same time, to avoid the spread of false messages, a trust evaluation algorithm is designed. The fog node can validate the received massages from vehicles using Bayesian Inference Model. Based on the verification results, the road condition information is sent to the real-time map updating server so that the server can update the map in time and prevent the secondary traffic accident. In order to calculate the trust value offset for the vehicle, the fog node generates a rating for each message source vehicle, and finally adds the relevant data to the blockchain. According to the result of security analysis, this scheme can guarantee the anonymity and prevent the Sybil attack. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is effective and accurate in terms of real-time map updating and trust values calculating."

The advantage of edge networks is their pioneering integration of other prominent technologies such as blockchain and federated learning (FL) to produce better services on wireless networks. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system integrating blockchain technologies, 5G ENs, and FL to create an efficient and secure framework for transactions. FL enables user equipment (UE) to train the artificial intelligence model without exposing the UE's valuable data to the public, or to the model providers. Furthermore, the blockchain is an immutable data approach that can be leveraged for FL across 5G ENs and beyond. The recorded transactions cannot be altered maliciously, and they remain unchanged by design. We further propose a dynamic authentication protocol for UE to interact with a diverse base station. We apply blockchain as a reward mechanism in FL to enable computational offloading in wireless networks. Additionally, we implement and investigate blockchain technology for FL in 5G UE."

The sudden emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the drawbacks in our healthcare systems to handle public health emergencies. It is clear that implementing cutting-edge technology such as blockchain can aid in reducing the devastating effects of healthcare mishaps and promote efficient planning operations and resource deployment. In the healthcare sector, blockchain technology has the potential to improve clinical trial data management by minimizing regulatory approval delays and revitalizing communication between various parties in the supply chain, among other things. Furthermore, the propagation of misinformation has accelerated in recent years, and existing platforms lack the ability to verify the accuracy of data, resulting in public alarm and irrational behavior. As a result, building a blockchain-based tracking system is critical to ensuring that any data related to healthcare are collected in an accurate and trustworthy manner. Blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger distribution technology that can make data processing, provenance, and authentication simpler and has the potential to disrupt healthcare. Blockchain is being actively explored in the health sector to optimize business processes, lower costs, improve patient quality, improve compliance, and make better use of data relevant to healthcare. Nevertheless, the need to ensure that blockchain design elements consider specific healthcare needs from the different viewpoints of clients, patients, providers, and regulators is crucial in determining whether blockchain will fulfill the excitement of a technology described as ``revolutionary'' and ``disruptive.'' In addition, blockchain approaches must also be attentive to the specific problems facing healthcare relative to other sectors of the economy, in response to the actual needs of healthcare stakeholders. There have been many proposed implementations of blockchain in the healthcare sector, such as electronic health record (EHR) systems. In this chapter, we review the motivations of inculcating blockchain in currently existing EHR systems. The content of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 1 discusses a brief introduction of blockchain along with the EHR system and the current implementation of blockchain in the medical industry. The second section provides a deeper insight into the importance of mobile health, remote monitoring, and the motivations for using blockchain-based EHR systems. The third section will cover the details of a patient-centered blockchain model along with its promising features. The development of the COVID-19 pandemic has created a slew of difficulties around the world. The use of blockchain technology is critical in developing a platform for effectively managing the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of a precise mechanism to detect new infections and anticipate the coronavirus infection risk is the largest difficulty facing most nations. The numerous characteristics of blockchain technology, such as decentralization, transparency, and immutability, can aid in pandemic management by detecting breakouts early, expediting drug distribution, and safeguarding user privacy while undergoing treatment. In this chapter, we examine blockchain applications and potential in the fight against COVID-19, demonstrating that the proposed solution is cost-effective and assures data integrity, security, transparency, and traceability among stakeholders during the pandemic.

Nonetheless, the current drone-based systems have some limitations, such as the need for humans in control of large-scale drones, drone's energy inefficiency, repercussion of quality of service (QoS) from abnormalities events, shortages of automaticity and real-time interactions, deficiency of swift decisions from artificial intelligence-based SAR, and underestimation of security issues in SAR systems. Therefore, developing a more advanced drone-based system is necessary to overcome these limitations. However, it is challenging to achieve the target due to trade-off relationships of technologies and strict requirements of time-critical SAR. This paper studies the feasibility of an Internet-of-Drones (IoD) system using blockchain and artificial intelligence at the edge to overcome limitations and improve SAR QoS. An advanced IoD system architecture from drones to a back-end system and end-users terminals has been proposed. Furthermore, advanced edge services and artificial intelligence at the edge have been presented for automatically searching for missing persons. In addition, computation offloading approaches have been provided to improve the energy efficiency of drones and reduce system latency. Last but not least, public and private blockchain, including Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, for providing secure and decentralized healthcare platform has been investigated and analyzed to enable real-time interaction between healthcare entities and improves healthcare services. The results show that the proposed system helps overcome the limitations and improve the SAR QoS. Besides, the proposed system satisfies the security requirements, including confidentiality, integrity, authentication, authorization, access control, privacy, trust, transparency, availability, automaticity, and tolerance."

Thus, SM can provide a competitive edge for manufacturers that successfully adopt it. In the process of adopting SM, building blocks play a critical role and can be seen as prerequisites. Managers of manufacturing companies are interested in learning what building blocks are relevant and can help make their operations smarter and more competitive. Our paper is a first attempt to answer this question through presenting the most frequently used building blocks for SM adoption. In order to achieve this objective, we conducted a systematic mapping review to identify both building blocks as well as current methods for adopting SM. In a next step, we matched the building blocks with the adoption methods. This matching of building blocks with the adoption methods helped in determining whether a building block actually recommended in the methods for adopting SM. We found that intelligent control, data analytics, IT-based production management systems (e.g., ERP, CAx, etc.), smart products/parts/materials, interoperability, data sharing systems and standards are the most commonly used building blocks for manufacturers that are aligned towards adopting SM. As a consequence, the future manufacturing workforce needs to be prepared to understand analytics, sensors, etc. The results also showed that, although building blocks such as blockchain, robots, visual technology, and 3D printing may find their application in specific manufacturing sectors, overall, they are less commonly associated with SM adoption compared to the other building blocks."

Based on this, the asymptotic consensus is eventually achieved and the frequency of communication among agents is significantly reduced.
