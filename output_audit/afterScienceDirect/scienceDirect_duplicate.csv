With the increasing number of IoT users and devices, the demands for secure communication and data confidentiality are getting higher and higher, and the identity authentication and access control of IoT devices has become a huge challenge. In the IoT environment, the traditional device identity and access management methods based on public key infrastructure (PKI) and blockchain bring the problems of single point failure and scalability. The emergence of decentralized storage system and distributed ledger technology directed acyclic graph (DAG) provide new ideas to solve these problems. In the paper, we use distributed ledger technology IOTA with low energy demand to design a lightweight and scalable mechanism to manage the identity of IoT devices and access control of large-scale IoT data, so as to ensure source reliability and sharing security of IoT data. In the new scheme, IOTA technology is used to realize the functions of registration, update, revocation and retrieval of the identity of IoT devices, which solves the defects caused by centralized management. Inter planetary file system (IPFS) is used to store a large amount of data generated by devices in the IoT, which not only reduces the burden on devices and systems of IoT, but also solves the single point of failure, delay and other problems caused by traditional cloud storage. At the same time, the fog node is used to provide localized computing for a group of IoT devices to solve the problem of limited computing resources of IoT devices. In addition, in order to prevent data abuse caused by unauthorized devices accessing network resources, a trusted access control mechanism is designed to achieve fine-grained access control, access policy update and other functions, so as to better maintain the IoT environment and network security. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through simulation experiments, and the security and functions of the scheme are analyzed, which proves that the scheme meets the security demands of the IoT environment."

Privacy-preserving and data security challenges are among the many concerns impeding the goal of making data storage available and processing at the edge of the network quite difficult to implement. Authenticated users must be the only ones with access to their respective stored data which are protected against any form of intruder manipulation. Most authentication schemes proposed and implemented in edge computing and other paradigms use a trusted entity to initialize the authentication process between edge servers and prospective users. Servers and users are expected to register with the trusted party first before they are able to subsequently authenticate one another. The presence of the trusted party presents scalability issues as well as the threat of having a single point of failure which may threaten the availability of the entire network. In this paper, we present a fully decentralized approach to solving this problem by eliminating the public trusted entity within the network framework termed DecChain. In DecChain we employ some notable principles of permissioned blockchain technology in the rollout and authentication of elements within the network. Authenticated users within our proposed framework would not have to sign in to every service provider to be authenticated to access a service or resource. Security experiments and the deployment of our scheme are carried out to evaluate the performance of DecChain. The results show our scheme is secured and achieves the intended purpose efficiently."

Specifically, the paper affords the conclusion that in most instances of home automation, a potential topological place to start the blockchain is in the home gateway that supports the processing and computing required to aggregate or in-network-preprocess the data flows from the various appliances; however, the computing and storage requirements may limit this deployment paradigm to a subset of cases. Alternatively, the place to start the blockchain could be in the fog-to-core gateway point, but in this case this process does not fully guarantee end-to-end integrity. The actual Proof of Work (PoW) functionality would likely be in the core network and not in the relatively low computing-power home gateway. Another alternative envisions private local blockchains to be instituted in the home area network, but still not necessarily for all appliance-generated transactions due to the large volume of such status, event, and usage data."

However, the wide deployment of IoT suffers certain issues as well, such as interoperability, compatibility, heterogeneity, large amount of data, processing of heterogeneous data etc. Among others, energy efficiency and security are the utmost prominent issues. Scarce computing resources of IoT devices put hindrances on information sharing across edge or IoT network. Indeed, unintentional or malicious interference with IoT data may lead to severe concerns. In this study, the researcher exploits the potential benefits of a blockchain system and integrates it with software-defined networking (SDN) while justifying energy and security issues. More in detail, the researcher proposed a new routing protocol with the cluster structure for IoT networks using blockchain-based architecture for SDN controller. The proposed architecture obviates proof-of-work (PoW) with private and public blockchains for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communication between SDN controllers and IoT devices. In addition to this, distributed trust-based authentication mechanism makes blockchain even more adoptive for IoT devices with limited resources. The experimental results show that the proposed cluster structure based routing protocol outperforms the state-of-the-art Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV), Secure Mobile Sensor Network (SMSN), Energy efficient secured cluster based distributed fault diagnosis (EESCFD), and Ad-hoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV), in terms of energy consumption, network throughput, and packet latency.

A potential solution to this problem is the blockchain-based architecture. In addition, the complex nature of activities performed by humans in diverse healthcare environments reduces the qualitative measures for extracting distinct features representing various human actions.

In the proposed approach, frame-based salient features are extracted from videos consisting of different human activities, which are further processed into action vocabulary for efficiency and accuracy. Similarly, the classification of activities is performed using support vector machine (SVM) based on the error-correction-output-codes (ECOC) framework.

The patient information is sensitive and easily traced by the attackers due to insecurity, for that, we proposed the EiA-H2B model (Edge intelligent Agent Hybrid Hierarchical Blockchain) which includes five phases. Firstly we proposed Biological PUF based sensor authentication, which is a strong credential that provides high security. All the sensors are authenticated by the virtual authenticator that is deployed by a blockchain ledger. Due to the mobility of WBAN, we focused on handover that is done by Bi-Partite One to N matching theory. Secondly, we proposed high voting based virtual clustering, in this phase high voting sensor is elected as a super node and that is used to create a virtual cluster. Thirdly, we proposed duty cycle MAC scheduling protocol is used to predict the original state of the sensors which is done by Attention Matrix based Gated Recurrent Unit (AM-GRU), and then the timeslots are allocated for avoiding packet loss and retransmission. Fourth, we perform relay selection and routing that is done by Global Optimization based Artificial Electric Field Algorithm (AEFA). And finally, we predict emergency data and generate an alert in EiA using Human Learning aided State Action Reward State Action (SARSA) algorithm that finds the current state and predicts the corresponding action.

The key objectives are to improve the computation and processing of drone-based resource constraints and deliver the data to the outsourced computational node to schedule, process, manage, optimize, and preserve it since they are located close to each other through a wireless sensor network. This collaborative technological approach to robustness is the standard of drone system design and implementation, reducing the computational power, resource consumption, and latency for the application that needs a fast response. However, recent research into fog-enabled drone-based data management and optimization poses a serious challenge in terms of privacy, security, and preservation. On the other hand, Blockchain Hyperledger Technology, which is mostly used in Bitcoin Cryptocurrencies, has been applied in a large number of distributed applications due to the ledger integrity, transparency, trustworthiness, provenance, reliability, availability, protection, and security-related distributed features that are provided. Therefore, the distributed application of drone control has received more attention because of its ability to handle collaborative procedures to capture, schedule, process, optimize, manage, and preserve drone-based data using fog nodes and blockchain hyperledger technology. In this paper, we proposed a collaborative approach using blockchain hyperledger fabric and a metaheuristic-enabled genetic algorithm for fog node management called B-Drone. This approach handles drone-based data collection, scheduling, optimizing, processing, managing, and preservation in a secure manner in the fog node. The protection of each transaction between drone and fog node before exchange is private with the utilization of the hash-encryption (SHA-256) algorithm. The blockchain smart contracts are implemented and deployed to auto-manage all the connectivity and communication protocols between drones and fog nodes in the designed private permissioned network. The simulations of the proposed collaborative approach reduce the computing cost down to 12.03% and increase the performance up to 73.11%, thus decreasing the cost of drone-ledger preservation down to 30.13% and the robust usage of the network up to 54.29% as compared to other state-of-the-art methods ."

Devices such as blood-pressure monitors, glucose meters, heart monitoring implants, Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), and Electromyography (EMG) wearable devices allow health providers to collect the patient health information locally and make a real-time decision based on the Patient Health Data (PHD). Hospitals have been adopting the IoT for many years and now they have healthcare IoT devices in patients' rooms and their bodies. However, the medical agencies, hospitals, and companies do not consider the security risk of healthcare IoT devices connected to a Local Area Network (LAN) or Wide Area Network (WAN). The IoT devices can be easily hacked and may lead to several potentially life-threatening risks due to poor authentication and encryption practices. Existing machine learning algorithms and blockchain approach working in the cloud computing environment are unable to meet the Quality of Service (QoS) like reliability, authentication, identification, and security requirements of healthcare IoT devices. Most of the traditional machine learning algorithms and techniques for healthcare IoT lacks the real-world implementation for secure data transmission. Therefore, blockchain is introduced for secure and reliable transaction in healthcare IoT. Whereas Fog Computing (FC) is introduced to extend the services of the cloud at the edge of networks. Integration of FC with blockchain can overcome the issue of healthcare IoT device identification, authentication, and verification for scalable frequent data transmission in a decentralized environment. Hence, a novel solution for the abovementioned problem is proposed using FC and blockchain. It includes an FC-based three-tier architecture, an analytical model, a mathematical framework, and an Advanced Signature-Based Encryption (ASE) algorithm for healthcare IoT device identification, verification, and Patient Health Data (PHD) authentication.

By analyzing the generated results from the proposed novel ASE algorithm for throughput, packet error, reliability, and malicious node detection accuracy; it is observed that the ASE algorithm in the FC environment easily outperforms the cloud and the other existing state of the art techniques such as FogBus, Femto cloud, Blockchain Fog-based Architecture Network (BFAN), and BeeKeeper. The malicious node detection accuracy of the ASE algorithm in the FC environment is 91% and in the cloud is 83%. Whereas the reliability percentage of the ASE algorithm in FC is 95% and in the cloud is 87%. The proposed approach is tested on simulators iFogSim (Net-Beans) and SimBlock."

Besides, some malicious users may provide untrustworthy information to mislead others just for its selfishness. Hence, in this paper, we propose an efficient, reliable and privacy-preserving scheme based on blockchain for VSNs. In our scheme, pseudonym mechanism is employed to achieve individual anonymization by concealing the vehicles' identity. Moreover, to encourage vehicles to report trustworthy information, incentive-punishment mechanism is proposed. Meanwhile, we propose multi-factors and single-factor weight-based evaluation mechanism to evaluate the reliability of message. Additionally, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and blockchain are also employed to achieve consensus and store the records respectively, which can prevent malicious entities from manipulating on vehicles' reward scores and credit scores.

However, when using blockchain technology, the proof-of-work completed by vehicles may consume substantial energy and computing resources, which limits the application of blockchain technology in the internet of vehicles environment. Therefore, this paper considers deploying edge computing nodes to support blockchain technology and introducing an auction mechanism to encourage users to record vehicle driving data as miners. This paper proposes two auction mechanisms for the blockchain network formed by edge computing service providers and miners to maximize the social welfare. Specifically, one mechanism is used when the resource demands of the miners are the same, and the other is used when the resource demands of the miners are different. For resource allocation, the former uses the maximum cost maximum flow algorithm to achieve optimal allocation, and the latter uses a heuristic algorithm. For price payment, the former uses the Vickrey--Clarke--Groves mechanism, and the latter uses dichotomy. These two price payment algorithms use critical value theory to calculate the payment price. This paper demonstrates that both are truthful and individually rational. Through experiments, this paper evaluates indicators such as social welfare, satisfaction, and resource utilization. The experiments show that the proposed auction mechanism can effectively maximize social welfare in the blockchain network and provide an effective resource allocation strategy for edge computing service providers."

Thereby, amounts of edge devices are accessed to the City IoT leading to the computation resources explosion and security issues in the smart environment. Here, we study the security of the data sensing in smart IoT and propose a novel data aggregation scheme, named Fog-based Anonymous Reward Data Aggregation scheme (later referred to as FARDA), to preserve the user privacy for developing a sustainable City IoT system.

Meanwhile, blockchain technology is developing rapidly and has been applied to mobile scenarios with massive information interaction for establishing trust between mobile devices. However, the computing power of mobile devices is limited by the physical size and battery capacity, which is not enough to cope with the high computation overhead for blockchain mining process. Thus, offloading mining tasks to the edge servers becomes a viable option. This paper investigates both of the D2D task offloading problem and the mining task offloading problem in a blockchain-enabled beyond 5G network. For the purpose of efficient resource allocation, the former is formulated as a double auction market and the latter is formulated as a Stackelberg game.

However, when task participants submit tasks, they are likely to expose their data privacy and location privacy. These privacy will be maliciously attacked and exploited by attackers (external attackers and untrusted third party). With the rapid increase of MCS data throughput, traditional cloud platforms can no longer meet the huge data processing needs. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an MCS federated learning system based on Blockchain and edge computing. This paper uses federated learning as the framework of the MCS system. The system protects data privacy and location privacy by using the Double local disturbance Localized Differential Privacy (DLD-LDP) proposed in this paper. Because the sensed data exists in multiple modalities (text, video, audio, etc.), this paper uses the Multi-modal Transformer (MulT) method to merge the multi-modal data before subsequent operations. To solve the problem that the third party is untrusted, we utilize Blockchain to distribute tasks and collect models in a distributed way. A reputation calculation method (Sig-RCU) is proposed to calculate the real-time reputation of task participants. Through conducting experiments on real data sets, the effectiveness and adaptation of the proposed DLD-LDP algorithm and Sig-RCU algorithm are verified."

Moreover, existing security mechanisms are faced with the issue of monitoring and collecting historic data throughout the entire IoT network of the smart city in order to deliver optimal security and defense against cyberattacks. To address the current challenges, this paper proposes a decentralized security architecture based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) coupled with a blockchain technology for IoT network in the smart city that relies on the three core technologies of SDN, Blockchain, and Fog and mobile edge computing in order to detect attacks in the IoT network more effectively. Thus, in the proposed architecture, SDN is liable to continuous monitoring and analysis of traffic data in the entire IoT network in order to provide an optimal attack detection model; Blockchain delivers decentralized attack detection to mitigate the ``single point of failure'' problem inherent to the existing architecture; and Fog and mobile edge computing supports attack detection at the fog node and, subsequently, attack mitigation at the edge node, thus enabling early detection and mitigation with lesser storage constraints, cheaper computation, and low latency. To validate the performance of the proposed architecture, it was subjected to an experimental evaluation, the results of which show that it outperforms both centralized and distributed architectures in terms of accuracy and detection time."

In this blockchain network, we jointly optimize the mining decision and resource allocation to maximize the total profit of all miners. When using evolutionary algorithms to solve this problem, each individual usually represents the mining decisions and resource allocations of all miners, which results in the redundant search space due to the fact that not all miners participate in mining. In this paper, we propose a new differential evolution (DE) algorithm, called DEMiDRA. In DEMiDRA, each individual represents the resource allocation of a participating miner and the resource allocations of all participating miners constitute the whole population. Then, DE is adopted to optimize the resource allocation. As for the optimization of the mining decision, we need to select miners to participate in mining and update the number of participating miners. Since the population size is equal to the number of participating miners, we transform the update of the number of participating miners into the adjustment of the population size and design an adaptive strategy. Besides, a tabu strategy is developed to prevent unpromising miners from participating in mining. The effectiveness of DEMiDRA is verified by comparing it with three other algorithms on a set of instances."

However, we should address several challenges to facilitate the end-users finding and consuming the relevant services from the edge at the Internet scale. First, the scale and diversity of the edge hinder seamless access. Second, a framework where researchers openly share their services and data in a secured manner among themselves and with external consumers over the Internet does not exist. Third, the lack of a unified interface and trust across the service providers hinder their interchangeability in composing workflows by chaining the services. Thus, creating a workflow from the services deployed on the various edge nodes is presently impractical. This paper designs Viseu, a latency-aware blockchain framework to provide Virtual Internet Services at the Edge. Viseu aims to solve the puzzle of network service discovery at the edge, considering the peers' reputation and latency when choosing the service instances. Viseu enables peers to share their computational resources, services, and data among each other in an untrusted environment, rather than relying on a set of trusted service providers. By composing workflows from the peers' services, rather than confining them to the pre-established service provider and consumer roles, Viseu aims to facilitate scientific collaboration across the peers natively. Furthermore, by offering services from multiple peers close to the end-users, Viseu also minimizes end-to-end latency and data loss in the service execution at the Internet scale."

The blockchain can be leveraged to solve privacy, security, and single point of failure (third-part dependency) issues of IoT applications.

The performance is evaluated by training Random Forest (RF) and an optimized gradient tree boosting system (XGBoost) on distributed fog nodes. The proposed model effectiveness is assessed using an actual IoT-based dataset i.e., BoT-IoT, which includes most recent attacks found in blockchain-enabled IoT network.

In addition, blockchain concepts were adapted to the dynamic and restricted scenario of the D2D networks to prevent data interception and the alteration of indirect observations. Two uncertainty mathematical models were used to infer direct and indirect trust values: Bayesian inference and the Dempster Shafer Theory (DST) respectively. In addition, we have designed a clustering scheme that enables a faster and more lightweight blockchain for D2D networks. This ensures overhead will not increase with the number of nodes, and thus offers a scalable security solution.

Consequently, B5G-Driven edge computing allows a growing volume of data to be collected from and transmitted among pervasive edge devices for big data analytics. The collected big data becomes the driving force of artificial intelligence (AI) by training high-quality machine learning (ML) models, which is followed by severe individual privacy leakage. Federated learning(FL) is then proposed to achieve privacy-preserving machine learning by avoiding the exchange of raw data. Unfortunately, several major issues remain outstanding. Centralized processing costs significant communication resources between cloud and edge while data falsification problems persist. In addition, the private data may be reconstructed by malicious participants by exploiting the context of model parameters in FL. To solve the identified problems, we propose to integrate blockchain-enabled FL with Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) enabled differential privacy (DP) to protect the model parameters of edge devices in B5G networks. Blockchain enables decentralized FL to reduce communication costs between cloud and edge while alleviating the data falsification issues, and it also provides an incentive mechanism to alleviate the data island issue in B5G-Driven edge computing. WGAN is used to generate controllable random noise complying with DP requirements, which is then injected to model parameters. WGAN-enabled DP is able to achieve an optimized trade-off between differential privacy protection and improved data utility of model parameters. Time delay analysis is conducted to show the efficiency of the proposed model. Extensive evaluation results from simulations demonstrate superior performances from aspects of convergence efficiency, accuracy, and data utility."

This research article proposes a lightweight and privacy-preserving certificateless authentication scheme in fog-assisted VANET using blockchain technology and neuro-fuzzy machine learning technique. A new authentication scheme is designed using certificateless signature based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and hash function operation. The scheme utilizes two blockchains to achieve decentralized and transparent transactions and revocation process. In order to prevent denial-of-service attack, in which a roadside unit (RSU) is flooded with a massive amount of fake authentication requests so as to prevent legitimate nodes from being authenticated, a neuro-fuzzy algorithm is implemented to proactively detect and discard any anomalous requests prior to an authentication process. Moreover, the scheme is demonstrated to be semantically secure in the random oracle model (ROM) based on the intractability of the discrete logarithm problem (DLP). A panoptic analysis shows that the scheme possesses outstanding attributes required for a secure vehicular communication system. The experimental simulation is conducted using simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) and the broadly-accepted network simulator NS-3. The results indicate that the proposed scheme has a high efficiency in terms of transmission delay and message delivery rate. The comparative analysis with the state-of-the-art schemes reveals that the proposed scheme has an improvement of 50%--90.5% in computation cost and 38.46%--69.6% in communication overhead. The simulation result of the neuro-fuzzy gives an accuracy of 91.5% and further analysis shows that it significantly reduces the computation burden on the RSU proportionately with increase in the number of malicious messages."

With this new computing paradigm, new challenges arise in terms of security and privacy. These concerns are due to the distributed ownership of Fog devices. Because of the large scale distributed nature of devices at the Fog layer, secure authentication for communication among these devices is a major challenge. The traditional authentication methods (password-based, certificate-based and biometric-based) are not directly applicable due to the unique architecture and characteristics of the Fog. Moreover, the traditional authentication methods consume significantly more computation power and incur high latency, and this does not meet the key requirements of the Fog. To fill this gap, this article proposes a secure decentralised location-based device to device (D2D) authentication model in which Fog devices can mutually authenticate each other at the Fog layer by using Blockchain. We considered an Ethereum Blockchain platform for the Fog device registration, authentication, attestation and data storage. We presented the overall system architecture, various participants and their transactions and message interaction between the participants. We validated the proposed model by comparing it with the existing method; results showed that the proposed authentication mechanism was efficient and secure. From the performance evaluation, it was found that the proposed method is computationally efficient and secure in a highly distributed Fog network."

However, due to network propagation delay, blockchain fork may occur in the network of edge-enabled smart cities at some time. It can lead to double payment attacks and damage data integrity. To address this issue, this paper proposes a blockchain network propagation mechanism based on the resilient overlay network (RON) for edge-enabled smart cities. Firstly, it reconstructs the networking mode between the blockchain nodes in smart cities based on RON so that the blockchain nodes can quickly detect the link state of the Internet in smart cities. The shortest path algorithm and policy routing are then applied to construct the propagation path between the blockchain nodes to optimize the Gossip propagation mechanism and enhance the QoS and QoE.

The application of blockchain technology ensures the stability and dependability of data caching and transactions. In order to guarantee the security of data caching in the mobile edge computing environment and minimize the response time of caching servers, this paper proposes a decentralized data caching strategy in the mobile edge computing environment. The strategy uses a greedy algorithm to make the transmission delay of the requested content as small as possible under the multiple constraints of the storage space of each server and whether the content is cached on the server. To address the problem that data trading platforms are unable to afford the computation and storage of massive amounts of data and cannot guarantee that the data will not be leaked, this paper proposes a secure decentralized data transaction program. The scheme promotes the increase of transaction turnover rate and improves the revenue of both participating parties by establishing a buyer--seller matching algorithm. According to the experimental results, the proposed data caching strategy can improve the cache hit rate and reduce the transmission delay; the proposed data transaction solution can increase the revenue of both the data holder and the data buyer."

A shared tenancy model where multiple untrusted applications or tenants utilize the same pub/sub system is generally exploited in edge cloud, which poses crucial challenges including privacy-sensitive data/metadata access threat and critical metadata modification by unauthorized tenants. A centralized monitoring node is invariably adopted in existing security strategies (such as ACL, TLS), which causes the pub/sub streaming model vulnerable to external malicious attacks and single point failure. In this paper, inspired by outstanding features of blockchain including tamper-resistance, decentralization, strong consistency, and traceability, we propose BPS, a general and decentralized Blockchain-enhanced Pub/Sub communication model for multi-tenant edge cloud, to redesign pub/sub system internal security mechanisms. Specifically, by exploiting blockchain technology, BPS can detect the illegal operations and behaviors from both malicious tenants and untrusted publishers or subscribers. BPS directly leverages Merkel Hash Tree (MHT) of blockchain to verify the integrity of critical and confidential metadata. Regarding authorization, BPS introduces smart-contract-enabled fine-grained control over partition topic-classified messages by storing access control list (ACL) into an append-only blockchain ledger. Additionally, an incentive mechanism is employed in BPS to reward honest publishers and subscribers. We implement BPS prototype based on Kafka and EoS blockchain.

Additionally, this platform extension allows users to interact with and monitor the smart contracts already deployed in a blockchain network, hiding the implementation details from non-experts in blockchain. This approach was successfully applied to a case study of COVID-19 vaccines to monitor and obtain the temperatures to which these vaccines are continuously exposed, to process them and then to store them in a blockchain network with the aim of making them immutable and traceable to any user. As a conclusion, our approach enables the integration of blockchain with the low-code paradigm, simplifying the development of lightweight event-driven applications for smart contract management. The approach comprises a novel open-source solution that makes data security, immutability and traceability more accessible to software developers who are non-blockchain experts."

Due to rapid population growth, there is an urgent need for devising water saving solutions. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based incentivized edge computing framework for water saving using soft computing methodologies. The framework facilitates decision makers in creating awareness among people about water savings in a easily understandable scientific way. Our incentivized blockchain based model uses edge computing at the house nodes of the network to predict the actual usage of a particular household in the locality based on several factors such as number of people, average income of family, profession of the members and previous water demands. By using Feed Forward Networks and Mixture Density Networks, we predict the water usage in terms of input factors and historical usage respectively, thus incorporating machine computing into the framework. With the two values from these methods, a comparison is made with the actual amount of water used by the householders. This research proposes deployment of the smart contract on the blockchain network for efficient and accurate reward distribution. Incentives and rewards are given in the blockchain network to houses with lesser consumption and penalties are imposed when usage crosses predicted and historic usage. The model ensures that accurate incentives are provided to the people in order to motivate them to avoid wastage of water. Results show that the methods used in our work perform better than other relevant networks on a self-synthesized dataset. The proposed methods converge well and show higher spatio-temporal accuracy."

To improve the production efficiency in mass individualization of rapid PCB prototyping, this paper proposed a cloud-edge orchestration-based bi-level autonomous process control (CEO-BAPC) framework. A blockchained smart contracts-driven multi-agent system is established at the edge to realize efficient tasks coordination under disturbances. Based on the operation events data and control decisions collected at the edge, a customized deep learning-driven prediction model is established at the cloud for supporting the rescheduling decisions. The blockchained smart contracts (e.g., Stackelberg game solution) at the edge proactively decentralize short-term fine-grained individualized task execution among manufacturing units/machines and make the results available on upper-level deep learning model at the cloud for supporting holistic rescheduling decisions. The bi-level autonomous process control architecture avoids the inconsistency between holistic control and local execution under frequent random disturbances and thereby realizes efficient manufacturing of mass individualization.

In this study, we propose a novel, distributed blockchain-based security architecture that today's industrial edge-enabled IoT systems may use to strengthen their defences against cyberattacks. We develop a probabilistic model to estimate the success probability of a malicious attacker on blockchain-based edge network by considering (i) hardware-level attack, (ii) network-level attack (IoT, Edge), (iii) software-level attack, wallet, smart contract, and (iv) blockchain network-level attack. We analyze the proposed attack model for sixteen different cyberattacks: False Data Injection, Sybil, DDoS, Identity Spoofing, Side-Channel, Botnet, Backdoor Trojan, Targeted Code Injection, Social Engineering, Phishing, Sinkhole, Man-in-the-middle, SQL Injection, Consensus, Eclipse, and Block Mining. Our model considers scenarios where private keys are stolen, lost, or forgotten by certain nodes. To determine the probability that a malicious attacker will be successful, we develop a simulation environment (a blockchain-based edge network with 200 total nodes, which generates 47,540 samples). We then estimate the success probability of a malicious attacker based on the blockchain resiliency (fault-tolerance) provided by the consensus algorithm, attack types, attack location, and the network size for various scenarios. Our results demonstrate that blockchain-based edge networks are more vulnerable to malicious attacks based on: (i) cyber-attack types (90.96% for Botnet and Backdoor Trojan attacks higher than for other attacks, such as DDoS, SQL Injection and Sybil); (ii) attack location (90.18% for software-level attacks higher than hardware, network, and blockchain network-level attacks); and (iii) consensus algorithm (68.85% for Byzantine fault tolerance, BFT, higher than the Proof-of-Work, PoW). The IoT network vulnerability factor, or exposure factor, of cyberattacks, depends on the strategic importance of the application to the attacker. Our results should be validated in real-world experiments with a large number of nodes."

Energy trading among EVs and charging stations (CS) in a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) environment is one of the popular verticals in smart grid. However, processing the energy trading decisions at remote control centers lead to an increase in delay and network overhead. Apart from these issues, the security concerns while trading the energy in such an environment remain persistent. Therefore, to handle the aforementioned issues, this paper presents SURVIVOR: A Blockchain based Edge-as-a-Service Framework for Secure Energy Trading in software defined networking (SDN)-enabled V2G Environment. In the proposed framework, the energy trading decisions are processed closer to the location of EVs through edge nodes. Moreover, for securing the energy trading transactions, blockchain is used wherein the approver nodes are selected amongst all the present nodes on the basis of a utility function and are made responsible for validating the transactions. Once such nodes are selected, a consensus-based blockchain mechanism for secure energy trading in SDN-enabled V2G environment is presented. In this mechanism, edge nodes are responsible for generating proof-of-work puzzles. The proof-of-work is a unique hash value which is computed for each EV and the transactions for which the approver nodes compute the same proof-of-work for each EV are added in the blockchain. The complete scheme is backed by the SDN architecture to reduce the overall latency and increase the throughput of the smart transportation network. The results obtained prove that the proposed scheme is effective for trading the energy between EVs and CS while securing the underlying trading transactions using blockchain. Moreover, the communication and computation cost of the proposed scheme comes out to be small which proves that it can be used in real-world applications. The latency in the complete transportation sector is also greatly reduced by using the SDN-architecture."

In the scrambling phase, each agent is required to generate some perturbation signals and add them to the edges leading out of it. In the convergence phase, the agents update their states following a normal updating rule. It is shown that an internal honest-but-curious agent can obtain the privacy of a target agent if and only if no other agents can communicate with the target agent.

The highlight of the current work is to provide practically computable rates of convergence to consensus that hold for a large class of time-varying edge weights. A novel analysis technique based on classical notions of persistence of excitation and uniform complete observability is proposed. The new analysis technique for consensus laws under time-varying graphs provides explicit bounds on rate of convergence to consensus for single integrator dynamics. In the case of double integrators a minor modification to the standard relative state feedback law is shown to guarantee exponential convergence to consensus under similar assumptions as the single integrator case. The consensus problem is re-formulated in the edge agreement framework to which persistence of excitation based results apply. A novel application of results from Ramsey theory allows for proof of consensus and convergence rate estimation under switching graph topology. The current work connects classical results from nonlinear adaptive control and combinatorics to the modern theory of consensus over multi-agent networks.

Based on a factorization of Laplacian matrix, the initial MAS is firstly transformed into the so-called weighted edge dynamics, and then a design equivalence between the proposed PID consensus controller and the corresponding stabilizing controller for such weighted edge dynamics is presented via some graph theory results. Furthermore, by combining Lyapunov theory and Barbalat's Lemma, it is proved that both the stabilization of weighted edge dynamics and the consensus of MAS can be guaranteed even in the presence of external disturbances. In particular, some relationships between the transient time performance of weighted edge dynamics and the PID design parameters are given.

In this paper, we address the theoretical foundation and the necessary conditions for the convergence of opinion formation's nonlinear dynamics to the true states. For this purpose, we extend a probabilistic fuzzy model of opinion formation to include the effect of perceiving random and vague media content on the uncertainty of individuals' opinions. In this model, each individual faces an uncertain media that is statistically modeled. Hence the individual perceives a probabilistic fuzzy set of possible environmental states and shapes its probabilistic fuzzy opinion (belief) based on its perceptions and negotiations. Theoretical results reveal that the media contents should be statistically supportive of the true state and that the coefficients in the belief update algorithms should be selected within the extracted bounds for the perception aggregation process and the proposed optimistic and pessimistic assuring operators. Application to two networks with different sizes of 94 and 918 nodes with 1134 and 206869 edges, respectively, confirms these theoretical conclusions. These simulation results show that higher diversity is observed in the opinions of the highly connected individuals. Furthermore, convergence is delayed for the larger network, i.e. there remain few individuals with differing opinions until the late stages of convergence. It is also shown that model convergence to the true state may deteriorate if parameter settings do not adhere to the theoretically obtained bounds."

Two novel event-triggered strategies named adaptive dynamic event-triggered (ADET) schemes for one-to-all and one-to-one ETC are well developed, in which on-line triggering parameters associated with each node or edge and dynamic thresholds with updating laws are introduced, respectively. Firstly, an ADET consensus control protocol under one-to-all ETC is proposed and a sufficient condition for consensus is derived. Compared with most existing triggering rules, the on-line triggering parameter associated with each node makes the controller be designed in a fully distributed way. On the other hand, the proposed dynamic threshold has the potential of excluding Zeno behavior without sacrificing the system performance. Secondly, an ADET consensus control protocol under one-to-one ETC is studied, in which each agent asynchronously transmits its observer states to its neighbors depending on edge-based triggering functions. The one-to-one ETC provides a flexible self-regulated transmission mode. An effective fully distributed and observer-based consensus protocol is developed appropriately with available local measurement outputs, under which the agents are not required to have a priori knowledge of any global information.

The dynamic of information diffusion is divided into two processes, referred to as post transmission and post distribution, representing the users' behavior and the social network algorithm, respectively. Individuals also interact with the post content by slightly adjusting their own opinion and sometimes redefining friendships. Our results show that the dynamic converge to various scenarios, which go from consensus formation to polarization. Importantly, friendship rewiring helps promote echo chamber formation, which can also arise for particular networks with well-defined community structures.

Furthermore, the multi-resource allocation and task scheduling make this task the furthest from being straightforward.

By doing so, we improve reliability and low latency and achieve energy efficiency for SDN-enabled IoT networks. The A3C policy combined with the Blockchain is proved theoretically.

The controller depends only on relative information of the agents. Since finding the control gain for such controller is hard, we focus on finding an optimal controller among a classical family of controllers which is based on Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) and guarantees asymptotic consensus. Through analysis, we find that the energy cost is bounded by an interval and hence we minimize the upper bound. In order to do that, there are two classes of variables that need to be optimized: the control gain and the edge weights of the graph and are hence designed from two perspectives. A suboptimal control gain is obtained by choosing Q=0 in the ARE. Negative edge weights are allowed, and the problem is formulated as a Semi-definite Programming (SDP) problem. Having negative edge weights means that ``competitions'' between the agents are allowed. The motivation behind this setting is to have a better system performance. We provide a different proof compared to Thunberg and Hu (2016) from the angle of optimization and show that the lowest control energy cost is reached when the graph is complete and with equal edge weights. Furthermore, two sufficient conditions for the existence of negative optimal edge weights realization are given. In addition, we provide a distributed way of solving the SDP problem when the graph topology is regular."

Automatic extraction of field boundaries from satellite imagery would reduce the reliance on manual input of these records, which is time consuming, and would underpin the provision of remote products and services. The lack of current field boundary data sets seems to indicate low uptake of existing methods, presumably because of expensive image preprocessing requirements and local, often arbitrary, tuning. In this paper, we propose a data-driven, robust and general method to facilitate field boundary extraction from satellite images. We formulated this task as a multi-task semantic segmentation problem. We used ResUNet-a, a deep convolutional neural network with a fully connected UNet backbone that features dilated convolutions and conditioned inference to identify: 1) the extent of fields; 2) the field boundaries; and 3) the distance to the closest boundary. By asking the algorithm to reconstruct three correlated outputs, the model's performance and its ability to generalise greatly improve. Segmentation of individual fields was then achieved by post-processing the three model outputs, e.g., via thresholding or watershed segmentation. Using a single monthly composite image from Sentinel-2 as input, our model was highly accurate in mapping field extent, field boundaries and, consequently, individual fields. Replacing the monthly composite with a single-date image close to the compositing period marginally decreased accuracy. We then showed in a series of experiments that, without recalibration, the same model generalised well across resolutions (10 m to 30 m), sensors (Sentinel-2 to Landsat-8), space and time. Building consensus by averaging model predictions from at least four images acquired across the season is paramount to reducing the temporal variations of accuracy. Our convolutional neural network is capable of learning complex hierarchical contextual features from the image to accurately detect field boundaries and discard irrelevant boundaries, thereby outperforming conventional edge filters. By minimising over-fitting and image preprocessing requirements, and by replacing local arbitrary decisions by data-driven ones, our approach is expected to facilitate the extraction of individual crop fields at scale."

The fusion process depends on a total ordering of the variables, but both the problem of searching for an optimal consensus structure (according to the standard problem definition) as well as the one of looking for the optimal ordering are NP-hard. In this paper we start with this theoretical framework and extend it from a practical point of view. The two main methodological contributions we make are: (1) an adaptation of the well-known BN learning algorithm GES (Greedy Equivalence Search) to the case of having a set of BNs as input instead of data (we prove the correctness of the adapted algorithm, i.e., under certain standard assumptions the optimal solution for the BN fusion process is obtained); and (2) a heuristic method for identifying a suitable order of the variables, which allows us to obtain consensus BNs having (far) fewer edges than those obtained by using random orderings. Finally, we design several computational experiments to test our proposals. From the results, we can conclude that the consensus network can be efficiently obtained by using the proposed heuristic to compute the total order of the variables, with this DAG being very close to the optimal one."

According to Heider's hypothesis of balance certain combinations of positive and negative edges in a network confer stability-balance-to the networks, while others -- imbalanced networks -- are unstable and tend towards balance. Here, we review the concept of structural balance starting from ``first principles'' based on the original formulation of Heider. Based on Harary's ``tendency towards completeness'' hypothesis we formulate that a network is balanced if it can give rise to a balanced complete signed graph. We then propose an algorithm for edge completion of networks and prove several results concerning the balance of cycles, and graphs. We then consider balance as a dynamic process in which the entities of the system try to make agreements by pairs to reach consensus or ``agreed upon dissensus''. At this point we arrive at a few general conditions that any index quantifying the degree of balance -- or degree of imbalance -- has to have. We then analyze a degree of balance index proposed by Estrada and Benzi (2014) and show that it fulfills all these requirements. In contrast, we show how some other approaches to quantify the degree of balance are incomplete and we provide examples of the difficulties found with their use. Using all these developed conceptions about the level of balance in signed social networks we proceed to the study of the international relation among countries in the world for the period 1938--2008. We conclude that the system of international relations is highly imbalanced for the whole period with no trend to increasing balance with the passage of time. Finally, we consider the use of degree of balance indices relative to null models and clarify that they do not account for the degree of balance of a signed network but for the ``effort'' needed to create such degree of balance among a large set of randomly shuffled networks."

However, the inherent characteristics of the organic agricultural supply chain (OASC)--such as centralization, monopoly, and asymmetry--have repeatedly plunged OASC into the predicament of information non-transparency. Ultimately, it results in a severe trust crisis of consumers. Fortunately, the emerging blockchain and edge computing technology probably raise an opportunity to improve this issue. Despite the overwhelming advantage (such as tamper-resistant, trust-free, transparent, decentralized, and immutable), this technology has to overcome the imperfection of cost and efficiency before it can be employed by OASC, particularly for geographically dispersed small and medium-sized farms in remote areas. In this paper, we first leverage the immutability of blockchain and the paradigm of edge computing to construct an OASC's trust framework, which has a much better trade-off between cost and efficiency. Further, according to the scenarios of OASC, we divide all the stakeholders into four roles, proposing a novel consensus mechanism to manage the information flow. The evaluation results demonstrate that our proposal can significantly achieve the performance improvement as well as the cost decline compared to the traditional approach. This framework will also make affordable traceability solutions for those in developing countries at a low cost in the future."

Many efforts have been devoted to understanding how opinion dynamics is affected by network topology. However, social interactions are best characterized as temporal networks in which ordering of interactions cannot be ignored. Temporal activity patterns including heterogeneous contact strength and interevent times, turnover edge/node dynamics, and daily patterns could have significant effects that would not be captured by static aggregate network representations. In this paper, we study the effects of such temporal patterns on the speed of consensus formation in various models of continuous opinion dynamics using four empirical data sets, including three human face-to-face networks from different real-world settings and a social insect interaction network. We find that static, aggregated networks consistently overestimate the speed of simulated consensus formation while weight heterogeneity associated with frequency of interactions has an inhibitory effect on consensus formation relative to the behavior on unweighted networks. Moreover, the speed of consensus formation is found to be highly sensitive to nodal lifetimes, suggesting that randomization protocols that dramatically alter the distribution of lifetimes cannot be relied upon as reference models. On the other hand, temporal patterns including burstiness of interevent times and the lifetime of edges are found to have insignificant effects on consensus formation. The sensitivity to nodal lifetimes is further demonstrated via synthetic networks generated by an activity-driven model with tunable nodal lifetimes."

In some blockchain-enabled MEC using the best-known consensus algorithm proof-of-work (PoW), the computational efforts increase dramatically with the number of transactions, since a large amount of computational tasks should be conducted by miners with the limited computing resources in edge devices. Hence, improving the computational performance as an important but challenging issue in the design of blockchain system for MEC applications, has attracted intensive attention within last years. To further improve the performance of PoW algorithm, we present a novel implementation mechanism in this paper. Here, motivated by proof-of-deep-learning (PoDL) method in which the deep learning algorithm is used to maintain blockchain, through the design of a two-stage model to achieving computational tasks in PoDL-based blockchain systems, a novel computational-efficient consensus mechanism, named separate-proof-of-deep-learning (S-PoDL), is accordingly proposed. Thus, an energy-efficient blockchain-enabled MEC could be developed with our proposed S-PoDL, which arranges miners to carry out a two-stage-based computation on the basis of accounting_queue technique, while presenting the achieved models as proofs in MEC network. The comparative experiments are conducted between S-PoDL and PoDL, and the experimental results verify the feasibility and efficiency of our consensus mechanism S-PoDL for some blockchain-enabled MEC applications in relation to PoW-based cryptocurrencies, while effectively reducing computing burden of edge devices."

This is undesirable whenever the privacy of local interactions is concerned. In this paper, a different framework of the consensus protocol design with the consideration of authority management of accessing local controllers is provided, by using an edge-based implementation. In the scenario of the proposed designs, each local controller is realized by a parallel connection of a public element and a private element. The public elements are uniform and open access. However, the private elements are allowed to be significant nonuniform and are only known by the pairs of agents who share them. For both continuous-time multi-agent systems and their sampled-data counterparts, we provide the design criterions for the partial public protocols under both static and dynamic public elements, respectively. By exploring the edge sensitivity design approach, it is shown that the consensus can be achieved under the proposed protocols if the private control laws satisfy certain constraints dependent on the public ones and the network topologies. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the proposed design criterions."

The proposed fully-distributed consensus approach deals with the local scenario as compared to the traditional consensus control for the globally Lipschitz models. The dynamics of nonlinear systems are considered to satisfy the Lipschitz condition locally and an adaptive fully-distributed relative-state consensus protocol has been established for ensuring a coherent behavior of agents. A local leader-following adaptive consensus controller design condition, for obtaining the adaptive consensus protocol gain, has been formulated using the proposed local treatment, adaptation law for coupling weights, ellipsoidal regional investigation, asymptotic stability consideration, and Lyapunov redesign. The developed results are enriched for attaining a robust adaptive consensus of the locally Lipschitz multi-agents against disturbances by using the local L2 stability approach. This developed technique can be effective for minimizing the effect of external disturbances on the consensus error. From technical point of view, the proposed method can be used for the locally Lipschitz models, like systems having polynomial approximations in their models. Further, the proposed approach adapts (similar to routing in communication) in accordance with the requirement of control gains for a communication topology. Furthermore, our method can be applied to deal with the unwanted disturbance (like change in air flow speed or direction and external perturbations) for attaining a robust design. In contrast to existing studies, the proposed results consider adaptive and H∞ consensus schemes for the higher-order locally Lipschitz multi-agents. The developed results are verified for a network of six vendor pol multi-agent systems and modified Chua's circuits."

Efficient resource allocation methods are critical to delivering the customers with their required Quality of Service (QoS) priorities.

Among these convergent paradigms, Federated Learning (FL) allows the vehicles to train a deep ML model collaboratively, by exchanging model parameters (i.e., neural network weights and biases), rather than raw sensor data, via V2X links. Early FL approaches resorted to a server-client architecture, where a Parameter Server (PS) acts as edge device to orchestrate the learning process. Novel FL tools, on the other hand, target fog architectures where the model parameters are mutually shared by vehicles and synchronized in a distributed manner via consensus algorithms. These tools do not rely on the PS, but take advantage of low-latency V2X links. In line with this recent research direction, in this paper we investigate distributed FL methods for augmenting the capability of road user/object classification based on Lidar data. More specifically, we propose a new modular, decentralized approach to FL, referred to as consensus-driven FL (C-FL), suitable for PointNet compliant deep ML architectures and Lidar point cloud processing for road actor classification. The C-FL process is evaluated by simulating a realistic V2X network, based on the Collective Perception Service (CPS), for mutual sharing of the PointNet model parameters. The performance validation considers the impact of the degree of connectivity of the vehicular network, the benefits of continual learning over heterogeneous training data, convergence time and loss/accuracy tradeoffs. Experimental results indicate that C-FL complies with the extended sensors use cases for high levels of driving automation, it provides a low-latency training service, compared with existing distributed ML approaches, and it outperforms ego learning with minimal bandwidth usage."

Decentralized optimization plays a vital role in machine learning and has recently garnered much attention due to its inherent advantage in handling edge computations. Many decentralized optimization algorithms, both projection and projection-free algorithms with theoretical guarantees, have been proposed in the literature, focusing mainly on offline settings. However, for most real-world machine learning problems, the data is often revealed online, for example, in the case of recommender systems, image/video processing, and stock portfolio management. Therefore, in this work, we study decentralized optimization within the framework of online settings with constraints imposed on the optimization solutions (e.g., sparsity or low rank of matrices). More specifically, we consider the problem of optimizing an aggregate of convex loss functions that arrive over time such that their components are distributed over a connected network. We present a consensus-based online decentralized Frank-Wolfe algorithm that uses stochastic gradient estimates, which achieves an asymptotically tight regret guarantee of O(T) where T is a given time horizon.

It expands the capacity of cloud by facilitating data from the end devices to be stored and processed at the edge of the network closer to the data instead of delivering it to the cloud. Data integrity is a big concern in edge computing. As a promising solution to data integrity, blockchain is viable to protect the data in edge computing systems. However, most existing consensus algorithms cannot meet the requirements of edge computing in a dynamic network, where the nodes may join or leave the blockchain network dynamically. In this paper, we introduce a two-layer blockchain-based framework to provide data integrity in edge computing, and propose a novel Dynamic Random Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DR-BFT) consensus algorithm. DR-BFT consists of three sub-algorithms, String Consensus, Data Correctness Validation, and Binary Consensus. String consensus tries to reach consensus on the data of end devices or edge servers, and the sub-algorithm is based on an agreement and borrows some ideas from the Phase King Protocol. If the string consensus fails ``early termination'', each node will agree on a value from a random primary node and go through data correctness validation sub-algorithm. The system then reaches consensus on the data with binary consensus sub-algorithm which is a variant of Ben-Or and Michael's Random Consensus. We also propose an improved quorum method to cope with contention and dynamic node leaving/joining. We analyze DR-BFT with regard to consensus correctness, security, and system overhead. DR-BFT satisfies agreement, validity and termination. We conduct experiments through simulations. Experimental results show that the proposed consensus DR-BFT can effectively improve the performance in dynamic edge computing, including communication overhead and consensus latency."

Novel design conditions, including the necessary and sufficient conditions for the main design approach, by application of decoupling technique for consensus protocol formulation of OSL systems, are presented to evaluate the consensus protocol gains. A distinctive feature of the present work is the development of adaptive output feedback consensus protocol to avoid the state availability requirement in the existing works, by application of an edge-based consensus protocol, Lyapunov theory, graph topology, and nonlinearity bounds. The proposed approach is less conservative and more efficient than existing methods as it can be applied to a broader class of nonlinear systems with large Lipschitz constant.

To develop fully distributed seeking strategies, two adaptive control laws, including a node-based control law and an edge-based control law, are proposed. In the node-based adaptive strategy, each player adjusts their own weight on their procurable consensus error dynamically. Moreover, in the edge-based algorithm, the fully distributed strategy is designed by adding an adaptively adjusted scaling parameter to the weights of the edges of the communication graph. With the adaptive control laws, the proposed methods are free of any centralized control gains, i.e., the players can update their actions without knowing any centralized information. By utilizing LaSalle's invariance principle, it is shown that the Nash equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under both strategies. In addition, we further show that the edge-based method can be easily adapted to accommodate time-varying communication conditions, in which the communication network is switching among a set of undirected and connected graphs. In the last, numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

The goal of studying the control vs diseases cohorts is to understand that what biological pathways are perturbed in the manifestation of the disease. Although many genetic mutations are associated with the disease, they have varying rate of risk among different patients. This is due the different genomic landscape and environmental conditions that varies from individual to individual. This raises a question that how different set of mutations are linked to the manifestation of the same disease? This can be answered by identifying the consensus gene/biological pathways that are perturbed under disease condition even if the disease has manifested through different set of mutations. To understand this we propose a network-based strategy for gene prioritisation that combines the knowledge of disease associated mutations and the expression pattern of genes in different samples from patients and healthy-controls. The network comprises of three layers, first being the genes with PD associated mutations. The third or target layer comprises of the core pathways associated with PD pathology and the middle layer is composed interacting partners between these two layers. A scoring mechanism for edges was developed using gene expression profiles across different samples and the busiest routes/paths were discovered between the first and the third layer. The results highlight a subset of genes from the middle layer of the network and could classify between the control vs patients sample using machine learning algorithm and are significantly associated with PD pathways."

In Smart Farming environments, IoT and DLT enable resource monitoring and traceability in the value chain, allowing producers to optimize processes, provide the origin of the produce and guarantee its quality to consumers.

The software is organized as a multi-level simulator that permits to simulate a virtual environment, made of many nodes running the protocol of a specific Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), such as the Bitcoin or the Ethereum blockchains. This virtual environment is executed on top of a lower-level Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network overlay, which can be structured based on different topologies and with a given number of nodes and edges. Functionalities at different levels of abstraction are managed separately, by different software modules and with different time granularity. This allows for accurate simulations, where (and when) it is needed, and enhances the simulation performance. Using LUNES-Blockchain, it is possible to simulate different types of attacks on the DLT. In this paper, we specifically focus on the P2P layer, considering the selfish mining, the 51% attack and the Sybil attack. For which concerns selfish mining and the 51% attack, our aim is to understand how much the hash-rate (i.e. a general measure of the processing power in the blockchain network) of the attacker can influence the outcome of the misbehavior. On the other hand, in the filtering denial of service (i.e. Sybil Attack), we investigate which dissemination protocol in the underlying P2P network makes the system more resilient to a varying number of nodes that drop the messages. The results confirm the viability of the simulation-based techniques for the investigation of security aspects of DLTs."

The blockchain is a tamper-evident, unforgeable distributed ledger that protects security and privacy through the famous algorithm zk-SNARK, which is also widely used in virtual digital currencies such as Zcash. In addition, by using zk-SNARK technology in the Loopring DEX 3.0 in Ethereum, not only decentralization but also transaction performance can be guaranteed. However, there are three main problems of zk-SNARK, one is the need to guarantee calculation accuracy, two is the long time to generate evidence, especially when using Lagrangian interpolation to QAP the transaction data requires more computation; the last is the poor scalability, especially when nodes need to recalculate all data when adding new transactions.

SG also allows two-way real-time communication between utilities and customers using cloud and Fog enabled infrastructures. SG minimizes management and operations cost, electricity theft, electricity losses, and maximize user comfort by giving the user choice about their energy use. It also facilitates Renewable Energy Resources (RER) and electric vehicles. Blockchain is a promising technology, provides the necessary features to solve most of these issues. Current Issues include saving a large amount of data, deletion, tampering, and revision of data. It also eliminates the necessity of intermediaries. Inherent security, along with the distributed nature, makes it a perfect candidate for improving the overall services. The rules of the smart contract are automatically enforced upon execution. Smart contracts are enhanced in a way that per-unit price is calculated dynamically based upon RER and utilities generated energy units in the overall grid. The system is also automated in a way that electricity is transferred from one resident (or service) to another resident according to their requirements. The exchange of energy is done via a smart contract after checking the needs of each participant. Each participant defines their requirements at the time of the registration and can update these thresholds. The privacy protection scheme has higher security, shown by theoretical security analysis. The main contributions of our work are two-fold; Using smart contracts to automate the bidding process for transactions based upon supply and demand for energy in smart cities. Secondly, at the same time, using hyper ledger fabric and composer to leveraging Blockchain to uphold privacy, anonymity, and confidentiality at the same time giving the users ability to have dynamic pricing based on supply and demand."

Global government efforts and policies are already inclining towards leveraging better industrial energy efficiencies and energy savings. This provides a promising future for the development of a digital twin-based energy-saving system in the industry. Foreseeing some potential challenges, this paper also discusses the importance of symbiosis between researchers and industrialists to transition from traditional industry towards a digital twin-based energy-saving industry.

In order to ensure that special vehicles can quickly pass through crowded road and arrive at the accident scene in time, this paper proposes a blockchain-based special vehicles priority access guarantee scheme (BSV-PAGS). In BSV-PAGS, we introduce blockchain into the Internet of Things (IoT), and construct a decentralized distributed edge node network based on blockchian, which guarantees the information sharing among the edge nodes as well as processing the data efficiently. The intelligent terminal device will upload the special vehicle information to the edge node in the blockchain, and then the uploaded information will sync to each edge node through the information sharing smart contract, realizing the information sharing among the edge nodes. In addition, we use machine learning method (e.g. Bag of Visual Words and Support Vector Machine) to design and train special vehicle detectors to improve the recognition accuracy of special vehicles. We design a special vehicle priority access smart contract to achieve real-time scheduling of vehicles and ultimately ensure the priority of special vehicles. Then, we carried out a security analysis of BSV-PAGS. Finally, we test a large number of simulation experiments based on Ethereum clients.

In the first phase, a secure data aggregation through 6G sensors is performed at the data plane. Then, in the second phase, the aggregated data is sent to the 6G-enabled NFV control plane to leverage resource allocation to connected autonomous smart vehicles (CASVs) through edge nodes via service container operations. In the third phase, management plane operations are designed that includes registration and auction smart contracts (SC) for connected autonomous vehicle owner (CAVO) and CASVs over the BC with public/private pairs fetched from interplanetary file systems (IPFS). The proposed scheme is compared against existing NFV schemes like distant, edge, and SDN-based edge control.

More and more scholars focus on studying trust management and trust evaluation in IoT, but there is few research in ensuring that the feedbacks used in the trust evaluating process is trustworthy. Furthermore, a resource-constrained IoT node does not have enough memory to satisfy the usage of trust computation and maintenance. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a blockchain-based trust management mechanism (BBTM), where the trustworthiness of sensor nodes will be evaluated by the mobile edge nodes.

To address this issue, we aim to design a novel blockchain-enabled batch authentication scheme in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-envisioned IoV-based smart city deployment. The latest trends and revolutions in technologies incorporate AI/Machine Learning (ML) in blockchaining to produce a secure, efficient and intelligent blockchain based system. The data stored in the blocks in the blockchain are authentic and genuine, which makes the AI/ML algorithms to work at their exceptions in order produce correct predictions on the blockchain data. Through the signing phase of the proposed scheme, each vehicle in a dynamically formed cluster broadcasts a message to its own member and respective road-side unit (RSU). In the proposed scheme, two types of authentication take place: vehicle to vehicle (V2V) authentication allows a vehicle to authenticate its neighbor vehicles in its cluster, while batch authentication permits a group of cluster vehicles to be authenticated by their RSU. At the end, a group key is established among the vehicles and RSU in their cluster. RSU then gathers securely data from its vehicles and form several transactions including the information of vehicles and its own given information to the cluster member vehicles. The transactions are formed later by the nearby fog server associated with RSU and then by the cloud server to form a complete block. The created blocks are mined by the cloud servers in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud server network through the voting-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm. The authentic and genuine data of the blockchain are utilized for Big data analytics through AI/ML algorithms. It is shown that the proposed scheme is highly robust against various attacks through formal and informal security analysis, and also through formal security verification tool. A detailed comparative analysis reveals that the proposed scheme achieves superior security and functionality features, and offers comparable storage, communication and computational costs as compared to other existing competing schemes. Finally, the blockchain implementation has been carried out on the proposed scheme to show its effectiveness."

According to the existing literature and socio-psychological theories, we examine three specializations of state-dependent susceptibility, that is, stubborn positives scenario, stubborn neutrals scenario, and stubborn extremists scenario. Interactions among agents form a signed graph, in which positive and negative edges represent friendly and antagonistic interactions, respectively. We conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the generalized nonlinear opinion dynamics. For stubborn positives and stubborn neutrals scenarios, the general model is well-posed if and only if the system matrix is diagonally dominant. Based on the property of limit set and the existing results, we obtain some sufficient conditions such that the states of all agents converge to specific equilibrium point or bipartite consensus. For stubborn extremists scenario, by using the Perron--Frobenius property of eventually positive matrices, we establish some sufficient conditions such that the states of all agents converge into the subspace spanned by the right positive eigenvector of an eventually positive matrix. When there exists at least one entry of the equilibrium point or right positive eigenvector which is not equal to one, the derived results can be used to describe different levels of an opinion.

There are several reasons that this is likely: (1) Although the Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification examination is the standard prolapse staging system used in the Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery field for reporting outcomes, this assessment is not used commonly in clinical care outside the subspecialty; (2) no clinically useful and accepted definition of apical support loss exists, and (3) no consensus or guidelines address the degree of apical support loss at which an apical support procedure should be performed routinely. Objective The purpose of this study was to identify a simple screening measure for significant loss of apical vaginal support. Study Design This was an analysis of women with Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification stage 0-IV prolapse. Women with total vaginal length of ≥7 cm were included to define a population with ``normal'' vaginal length. Univariable and linear regression analyses were used to identify Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification points that were associated with 3 definitions of apical support loss: the International Consultation on Incontinence, the Pelvic Floor Disorders Network revised eCARE, and a Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification point C cut-point developed by Dietz et al. Linear and logistic regression models were created to assess predictors of overall apical support loss according to these definitions. Receiver operator characteristic curves were generated to determine test characteristics of the predictor variables and the areas under the curves were calculated. Results Of 469 women, 453 women met the inclusion criterion. The median Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification stage was III, and the median leading edge of prolapse was +2 cm (range, --3 to 12 cm). By stage of prolapse (0-IV), mean genital hiatus size (genital hiatus; mid urethra to posterior fourchette) increased: 2.0 $\pm$ 0.5, 3.0 $\pm$ 0.5, 4.0 $\pm$ 1.0, 5.0 $\pm$ 1.0, and 6.5 $\pm$ 1.5 cm, respectively (P 3.75 cm was highly predictive of apical support loss (area under the curve, >0.8 in all models). Conclusions Increasing genital hiatus size is associated highly with and predictive of apical vaginal support loss. Specifically, the Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification measurement genital hiatus of ≥3.75 cm is highly predictive of apical support loss by all study definitions. This simple measurement can be used to screen for apical support loss and the need for further evaluation of apical vaginal support before planning a hysterectomy or prolapse surgery."

Specifically, it addresses the addition of stable PFCs on agents that interact with each other using diffusive couplings. The value in the application of such PFC is twofold. Firstly, it has been an issue that output synchronization among passivity-short systems requires global information for the design of controllers in the cases when initial conditions need to be taken into account, such as average consensus and distributed optimization. We show that a stable PFC can be designed to passivate a passivity-short system while its output asymptotically vanishes as its input tends to zero. As a result, output synchronization is achieved among these systems by fully distributed controls without altering the original consensus results. Secondly, in the literature of output synchronization over signed weighted graphs, it is generally required that the graph Laplacian be positive semidefinite, i.e., L≥0 for undirected graphs or L+LT≥0 for balanced directed graphs. We show that the PFC serves as output feedback to the communication graph to enhance the robustness against negative weight edges. As a result, output synchronization is achieved over a signed weighted and balanced graph, even if the corresponding Laplacian is not positive semidefinite."

This paper, based on the `Back from the edge' project, evaluates the development and implementation of an intervention to reduce and prevent the impact of occupational stress in the RAN workforce in the Northern territory. Methods The methods involved a combined participatory action research/organisational development model, involving seven steps, to develop and implement system changes within the (then) Northern Territory Department of Health and Families (NTDH&F). The development, implementation and evaluation was informed via information from participants collected during workshops and interviews. Pre and post surveys were undertaken to evaluate the study. Results Occupational stress interventions developed by the workgroups were categorised into four main groups: (1) remote context, (2) workload and scope of practice, (3) poor management, and (4) violence and safety concerns. The main interventions centred on promoting a well educated, stable workforce. There were very few measurable changes as a result of the interventions as many were not able to be implemented in the time period of the study, but implementation is continuing. Conclusion While the outcome evaluations showed few effects, the study through consensus approaches, provides a blueprint for reducing stress among remote area nurses and evidence which should inform policy and practice with respect to service delivery in remote areas."

This requires cost-effective techniques to preserve the privacy and the security of model training within the resource-constrained environment. Traditional learning methods rely on the trust among the system for privacy and security. However, with the increase of the learning scale, maintaining every edge device's trustworthiness could be expensive. To cost-effectively establish trust in a trustless environment, this paper proposes democratic learning (DemL), which makes the first step to explore hardware/software co-design for blockchain-secured decentralized on-device learning. By utilizing blockchain's decentralization and tamper-proofing, our design secures AI learning in a trustless environment. To tackle the extra overhead introduced by blockchain, we propose PoMC (an algorithm and architecture co-design) as a novel blockchain consensus mechanism, which first exploits cross-domain reuse (AI learning and blockchain consensus) in AI learning architecture. Evaluation results show our DemL can protect AI learning from privacy leakage and model pollution, and demonstrated that privacy and security come with trivial hardware overhead and power consumption (2%). We believe that our work will open the door of synergizing blockchain and on-device learning for security and privacy."

In the past, researchers focused on evolution rules and opinion dynamics environments to monitor and even manage public opinion. In this study, we propose a novel structural-hole-based approach to control public opinion in social networks, hereinafter referred to as the SHCPO approach. We discuss the influence of both ordinary agents and structural hole spanners on opinion evolution using our improved Friedkin--Johnsen (FJ) model. Further, we analyze the evolution tendency of public opinion, which leads to the final consensus of public opinion, via the FJ model with ordinary agents in a community and structural hole spanners in joint communities. We reveal three kinds of connections between structural hole spanners and ordinary agents in joint communities. These comprise structural hole spanners connecting (1) two opinion leaders; (2) two ordinary agents; (3) one opinion leader and one ordinary agent. The three connections will lead to different opinion evolution conditions. According to the structural balance theory, we reconstruct the social network by changing the connections between structural hole spanners and agents in different communities. This guides the public opinion tendencies of joint communities towards the positive. Experimental results demonstrate beneficial effects of the SHCPO approach. We use three evaluation indicators to compare the SHCPO approach to five alternative methods. The percentage of positive opinions is used as an evaluation indicator. The SHCPO approach, compared with adding informed agents, add edges, the method from WWW and varying susceptibility to persuasion method, which guide the agent with a negative opinion towards positive opinion, has improved about 17%, 10%, 9%, 1%, respectively."

This paper proposes a novel and general approach called three-point convex hull matching (3PCHM) for registering two point sets with similarity transform. First, convex hulls are extracted from both point sets. Triangular patches on the surface of convex hulls are specified by predefining their normal vectors, thus guaranteeing that all points are located on the same side of any randomly selected triangle plane. Second, the potential similar triangle pair set is obtained by comparing the length ratio of the edges on the two extracted convex hulls. Thereafter, the transformation parameters for each pairwise triangle are calculated by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the corresponding vertex pairs. Furthermore, a k-dimensional (k-d) tree is used to accelerate the closest point search for the whole point sets. Third, outliers that may lead to significant errors are discarded by integrating the random sample consensus algorithm for global optimization. Experiments show that the proposed 3PCHM is robust even with the existence of noise and outliers and is effective in cases of part-to-part registration and part-to-whole registration."

To do so, one of the most natural ways to represent these objects is through attributed graphs. Several existing graph extraction methods could be implemented and thus, numerous graphs, which may not only differ in their nodes and edge structure but also in their attribute domains, could be created from the same object. Afterwards, a matching process is implemented to generate the correspondence between two attributed graphs, and depending on the selected graph matching method, a unique correspondence is generated from a given pair of attributed graphs. The combination of these factors leads to the possibility of a large quantity of correspondences between the two original objects. This paper presents a method that tackles this problem by considering multiple correspondences to conform a single one called a consensus correspondence, eliminating both the incongruences introduced by the graph extraction and the graph matching processes. Additionally, through the application of an online learning algorithm, it is possible to deduce some weights that influence on the generation of the consensus correspondence. This means that the algorithm automatically learns the quality of both the attribute domain and the correspondence for every initial correspondence proposal to be considered in the consensus, and defines a set of weights based on this quality. It is shown that the method automatically tends to assign larger values to high quality initial proposals, and therefore is capable to deduce better consensus correspondences."

In the proposed model, each individual is considered as a node in a graph, and the influences are represented by edges. The proposed model considers positive (negative) edges for acceptance (rejection), while there is no connection for noncommitment. In addition, in the introduced nonlinear model, the weight of each edge, which represents the influence weight, changes depending on the opinions of the individuals in the network. Given the negative interactions, the influence graph of the network may be initially unbalanced; however, the proposed model presents that such graph seeks balance eventually.

We present QSMRim-Net, a data imbalance-aware deep neural network that fuses lesion-level radiomic and convolutional image features for automated identification of rim + lesions on QSM. Methods QSM and T2-weighted-Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (T2-FLAIR) MRI of the brain were collected at 3 T for 172 MS patients. Rim + lesions were manually annotated by two human experts, followed by consensus from a third expert, for a total of 177 rim + and 3986 rim negative (rim−) lesions. Our automated rim + detection algorithm, QSMRim-Net, consists of a two-branch feature extraction network and a synthetic minority oversampling network to classify rim + lesions. The first network branch is for image feature extraction from the QSM and T2-FLAIR, and the second network branch is a fully connected network for QSM lesion-level radiomic feature extraction. The oversampling network is designed to increase classification performance with imbalanced data. Results On a lesion-level, in a five-fold cross validation framework, the proposed QSMRim-Net detected rim + lesions with a partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (pROC AUC) of 0.760, where clinically relevant false positive rates of less than 0.1 were considered. The method attained an area under the precision recall curve (PR AUC) of 0.704. QSMRim-Net out-performed other state-of-the-art methods applied to the QSM on both pROC AUC and PR AUC.

The scheme addresses the research gaps of fixed static allocation for miners to perform computationally intensive mining tasks through a multi-hop computational offloading (CO) scheme and addresses an auction mechanism for a fair bidding process among the miner nodes. The scheme operates in three phases. In the first phase, a multi-hop CO scheme with a fair incentive policy is formulated for miners. The CO schemes offer guaranteed offloading services to mobile devices from far-edge systems through a chain of neighbor nodes. Then, in the second phase, MaaS is proposed to leverage expensive mining tasks through 5G-enabled pico/femtocells. Integration of 5G allows massive end-to-end device and service connectivity. As IIoT ecosystems have limited memory and compute requirements, MaaS assures that the proposed consensus has a responsive validation and mining time. To make the data exchange in the consensus process lightweight, and allow a large number of sensors to share the data in a lightweight manner, an effective consensus mechanism Lightweight Proof-of-Proximity (LPoP), is proposed that forms group validations instead of single block validation. The data is exchanged through javascript object notation (JSON) format, maintaining a steady transaction rate. MB-MaaS is compared against the existing scheme for parameters bid thresholds and request servicing times, and mining and consensus formation. For example, the request serving time at 12 requests is improved by 56.78%, and a significant improvement of 26.47% is observed for processed blocks; parsing time on average is improved by 7.89%. The comparative analysis suggests that the scheme is more efficient than other competing approaches."

In the case of friendship graph with at least three blades, it is shown that the Pareto frontier is reduced to a global minimum point which is same as the optimal point corresponding to the minimum spanning tree of the friendship graph, i.e., the star topology.

To address the problems, this study presents a semi-automated approach that can obtain required parameters to create as-built BIMs for steel structures with complex connections from terrestrial laser scanning data. An algorithm based on principal component analysis (PCA) and cross-section fitting techniques is developed to retrieve the position and direction of each circular structural component from scanning data. An image-assisted edge point extraction algorithm is developed to effectively extract the boundaries of planar structural components. Normal-based region growing algorithm and random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm are adopted to model the connections between structural components. The proposed approach was validated on a bridge-like steel structure with four different types of structural components. The extracted as-built geometry was compared with the as-designed geometry to validate the accuracy of the proposed approach. The results showed that the proposed approach could efficiently and accurately extract the geometry information and generate parametric BIMs of steel structures."

In this paper, a decentralized optimization model for the trading community formation is proposed based on the Lp-box consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), where the network features of the physical systems are explicitly represented by power loss and wheeling charging in local and regional trading level, respectively. The framework for multi-level hybrid trading network construction is introduced involving three different trading modes, i.e, traditional trading mode, agent-based trading mode and peer-to-peer (P2P) trading mode, and two hybrid trading networks, namely Traditional trading & Agent based trading (TA) and Traditional trading & Peer-to-peer trading & Agent based trading (TPA), are developed based on the trading community formation results. The corresponding profit allocation schemes are also presented for the TA and TPA hybrid trading networks respectively. A set of complex network indices is applied to analyze the network characteristics of the TA and TPA trading topologies, while the link entropy (LE) index is used to evaluate the edge significance of the communication relationship network in maintaining global connectivity. Finally, the proposed models are validated via a test system with six IEEE 33-bus systems connected through the IEEE 9-bus system. The results show that the agent-based strategy can benefit all entities compared with the SDR and contribution-based strategies, while the REO (renewable energy output)-first strategy proposed for P2P pairing is more stimulating for the selling entities with larger REOs than distance-first mode. In addition, the entities' prices in the bi-level trading are significantly improved compared with those of the single-level trading both for agent-based trading and P2P trading. The complex index values of TA are all slightly greater than those of TPA, and a feeder with fewer managers is likely to have a larger LE value. The proposed models for trading community formation and trading network formation provide significant means for the development of sustainable LEMs."

Due to large differences in the phenomena measured by these modalities, the assumptions necessary to make inferences about axonal connections, and the limitations accompanying each, brain connectivity remains an elusive concept. Despite this, only a handful of studies have directly compared connectivity as inferred from multiple modalities, and there remains much ambiguity over what the term is actually referring to as a biological construct. Here, we perform a direct comparison based on the high-resolution and high-contrast Enhanced Nathan Klein Institute (NKI) Rockland Sample neuroimaging data set, and the CoCoMac database of tract tracing studies. We compare four types of commonly-used primate connectivity analyses: tract tracing experiments, compiled in CoCoMac; group-wise correlation of cortical thickness; tractographic networks computed from diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI); and correlational networks obtained from resting-state BOLD (fMRI). We find generally poor correspondence between all four modalities, in terms of correlated edge weights, binarized comparisons of thresholded networks, and clustering patterns. fMRI and DWI had the best agreement, followed by DWI and CoCoMac, while other comparisons showed striking divergence. Networks had the best correspondence for local ipsilateral and homotopic contralateral connections, and the worst correspondence for long-range and heterotopic contralateral connections. k-Means clustering highlighted the lowest cross-modal and cross-species consensus in lateral and medial temporal lobes, anterior cingulate, and the temporoparietal junction. Comparing the NKI results to those of the lower resolution/contrast International Consortium for Brain Imaging (ICBM) dataset, we find that the relative pattern of intermodal relationships is preserved, but the correspondence between human imaging connectomes is substantially better for NKI. These findings caution against using ``connectivity'' as an umbrella term for results derived from single empirical modalities, and suggest that any interpretation of these results should account for (and ideally help explain) the lack of multimodal correspondence."

A critical issue of such interactions is given by the strategy of protein search for specific targets on DNA. The mechanisms by which the protein are able to find relatively small cognate sequences, typically 15--20 base pairs (bps) for repressors, and 4--6 bps for restriction enzymes among the millions of bp of non-specific chromosomal DNA have hardly engaged researchers for decades. Recent experimental studies have generated new insights on the basic processes of protein-DNA interactions evidencing the underlying complex dynamic phenomena involved, which combine three-dimensional and one-dimensional motion along the DNA chain. It has been demonstrated that protein molecules have an extraordinary ability to find the target very quickly on the DNA chain, in some cases, with two orders of magnitude faster than the diffusion limit. This unique property of protein-DNA search mechanism is known as facilitated diffusion. Several theoretical mechanisms have been suggested to describe the origin of facilitated diffusion. However, none of such models currently has the ability to fully describe the protein search strategy. In this paper, we suggest that the ability of proteins to identify consensus sequences on DNA is based on the entanglement of π-π electrons between DNA nucleotides and protein amino acids. The π-π entanglement is based on Quantum Walk (QW), through Coin-position entanglement (CPE). First, the protein identifies a dimer belonging to the consensus sequence, and localize a π on such dimer, hence, the other π electron scans the DNA chain until the sequence is identified. Focusing on the example of recognition of consensus sequences of EcoRV or EcoRI, we will describe the quantum features of QW on protein-DNA complexes during the search strategy, such as walker quadratic spreading on a coherent superposition of different vertices and environment-supported long-time survival probability of the walker. We will employ both discrete- or continuous-time versions of QW. Biased and unbiased classical Random Walk (CRW) have been used for a long time to describe the Protein-DNA search strategy. QW, the quantum version of CRW, has been widely studied for its applications in quantum information applications. In our biological application, the walker (the protein) resides at a vertex in a graph (the DNA structural topology). Differently to CRW, where the walker moves randomly, the quantum walker can hop along the edges in the graph to reach other vertices entering coherently a superposition across different vertices spreading quadratically faster than CRW analogous evidencing the typical speed up features of the QW. When applied to a protein-DNA target search problem, QW gives the possibility to achieve the experimental diffusional motion of proteins over diffusion classical limits experienced along DNA chains exploiting quantum features such as CPE and long-time survival probability supported by the environment. In turn, we come to the conclusion that, under quantum picture, the protein search strategy does not distinguish between one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) cases."

Understanding how asymmetric uplift influences the drainage divide, and therefore mountain asymmetry, is one of the preconditions for extracting tectonic information from topography. However, there is no consensus on this fundamental problem. Here we combined analytical solutions and numerical landscape evolution modeling to examine the impact of two key parameters (uplift gradient, and ratio of uplift rates at two edges) on mountain asymmetry. We followed the convention by assuming uniform gradient of uplift rate and erosion coefficient across the drainage divide. Our analytical approach and numerical simulations show that mountain asymmetry is not always controlled by the uplift gradient as previously suggested; instead, it is governed by the ratio of uplift rates at two edges across the divide. We quantified the relationship between the normalized divide location and the ratio of uplift rates. We applied the new formula to two natural examples to reconstruct the tectonics from the locations of the drainage divides. Moreover, we compared the influences of vertical and horizontal movements on the mountain asymmetry in different situations. The result suggests that in mountain belt with weak tectonic activity or high erosion coefficient, the mountain asymmetry is mainly controlled by the ratio of uplift rates."

There is however no consensus and empirical evidence on how a given brain atlas affects the model outcome, and the choice of parcellation is still rather arbitrary. Accordingly, we explore the impact of brain parcellation on inter-subject and inter-parcellation variability of model fitting to empirical data. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive empirical evidence of potential influences of parcellation choice on resting-state whole-brain dynamical modeling. We show that brain atlases strongly influence the quality of model validation and propose several variables calculated from empirical data to account for the observed variability. A few classes of such data variables can be distinguished depending on their inter-subject and inter-parcellation explanatory power."

It suggests that the variable coupling weights merely enhance or weaken the communication capacity among the nodes, while do not essentially change the structure of sensing graph. It hence gives some insight into the balance between performance index and configuration budget. Moreover, compared with the infinite precision computation algorithm, our quantization-based triggering rule is concretely designed to explore mild consensus criteria.

The physical and communication digraphs are generally different and the combination of these two graphs forms a cyber-physical system. The interactions between physical and communication graphs are the focus of this paper. We consider different interactions between two graphs, including the case when their pinned Laplacian commutes, the case of the communication graph with diagonalizable pinned Laplacian, and the case of two general graphs. Moreover, within each graph, the relations between the agents can be either collaborative or antagonistic. To capture this, the theory of bipartite consensus is used. Coordination protocols for different cases are designed that are distributed with respect to the communication graph, and overcome the detrimental effects of the signed physical graph. The proposed control methods are illustrated by simulation examples."

Then, an improved tracking protocol is developed by considering the case that only the outputs of neighbors can be obtained. With the aid of adaptive updating parameters, the two protocols do not utilize the minimum eigenvalue of Laplacian matrix, and can deal with the nonlinear dynamics of Lur'e systems in a fully distributed manner. Moreover, with the Lyapunov analysis framework, the tracking errors can be proved to converge to zero in both cases.

This paper proposes the Markov clustering ensemble (MCE) model to solve the weak stability and robustness of soft clustering ensemble. First, the base clustering algorithms are regarded as new features of the original datasets. Then, the results of the base clustering algorithms are the values of these features, which can break through the framework of consensus cluster ensemble. Second, as the base clustering results are discrete data, the maximum information coefficient is applied to measure their similarity. Accordingly, a graph-based cluster ensemble model can be constructed with row vectors as vertices and the similarity between row vectors as edges. Then, the Markov process can be applied to infer the graph-based cluster ensemble model; therefore, the MCE algorithm is designed according to the inference. To test the performance of the MCE algorithm, clustering algorithms and clustering ensemble algorithms are used to conduct comparative experiments on ten datasets.

To study the distribution of preferences that emerge in such situations, a useful approach is to simulate opinion dynamics on top of complex networks, composed by nodes (individuals) and their connections (edges), where the state of each node can be one amongst several opinions including the undecided state. We analyze two different dynamics: the one proposed by Travieso and Fontoura (TF) and the plurality rule (PR), which are paradigmatic of outflow and inflow dynamics, respectively. We are specially interested in the impact of the network randomness on the final distribution of opinions. For that purpose, we consider Watts--Strogatz networks, which possess the small-world property, and where randomness is controlled by a probability p of adding random shortcuts to an initially regular network. Depending on the value of p, the average connectivity 〈k〉, and the initial conditions, the final distribution can be basically (i) consensus, (ii) coexistence of different options, or (iii) predominance of indecision. We find that, in both dynamics, the predominance of a winning opinion is favored by increasing the number of reconnections (shortcuts), promoting consensus. In contrast to the TF case, in the PR dynamics, a fraction of undecided nodes can persist in the final state. In such cases, a maximum number of undecided nodes occurs within the small-world range of p, due to ties in the decision group."

Although some studies have given some methods for green supplier selection, the consensus problem has not been sufficiently studied in the existing methods. In order to solve this problem, we propose a group consensus decision making framework to help choosing the best green supplier for electronics manufacturing. Firstly, decision makers' preferences between the alternatives considered with respect to each criterion are elicited by the paired comparison method, and expressed as probabilistic linguistic preference relations. Secondly, a new consistency measure is defined and a convergent algorithm is described to aid the consistency improvement process in a given probabilistic linguistic preference relation. The algorithm adopts a local revision strategy and can be easily interpreted. Further, for the consensus model, in each round of this dynamic and interactive model, the most incompatible expert is asked to revise his/her judgment according to judgment feedback mechanism. If the expert rejects the suggestion, his/her weight of importance will be decreased based on the weighting feedback mechanism. Finally, a case study of selecting green supplier is provided to illustrate the application of the proposed group consensus decision making framework."

However, in the absence of an established ground truth, it is difficult to determine the optimal procedure, and no consensus has been reached on the most effective approach to remove nuisance signals without unduly affecting the network intrinsic structural features. Here, we use a novel information-theoretic approach, based on von Neumann entropy, which provides a measure of information encoded in the networks at different scales. We also define a measure of distance between networks, based on information divergence, and optimal null models appropriate for the description of functional connectivity networks, to test for the presence of nontrivial structural patterns that are not the result of simple local constraints. This formalism enables a scale-resolved analysis of the distance between a functional connectivity network and its maximally random counterpart, thus providing a means to assess the effects of noise and image processing on network structure. We apply this novel approach to address a few open questions in the analysis of brain functional connectivity networks. Specifically, we demonstrate a strongly beneficial effect of network sparsification by removal of the weakest links, and the existence of an optimal threshold that maximizes the ability to extract information on large-scale network structures. Additionally, we investigate the effects of different degrees of motion at different scales, and compare the most popular processing pipelines designed to mitigate its deleterious effect on functional connectivity networks.

Revisiting the synchronization controllers that address unknown parameters via adaptive techniques, this work proposes a modification to the synchronization weights employed to enforce state agreement amongst the networked spacecraft. By augmenting a standard adaptive controller that accounts for unknown parameters, with adaptation of the synchronization weights, one opts to improve spacecraft synchronization. The interconnection strengths of the network nodes, responsible for enforcing synchronization amongst spacecraft, are weighted dynamically in proportion to the disagreement between the spacecraft states. Additionally, when all spacecraft are assumed identical, differing only in their orientation and initial conditions, a modification of the standard adaptive parameter laws allows to reach parameter consensus via a dynamic penalization on the pairwise differences of parameter estimates. The proposed adaptive control architecture which allows for adaptation of both parameter uncertainties and synchronization penalty terms is demonstrated via numerical studies of a four-spacecraft network with limited connectivity. As an alternative to the dynamic adjustment of the synchronization gains, a scheme is proposed to optimally select these gains. By considering the sum of deviation-from-the-mean and rotational kinetic energy as appropriate metrics for synchronization, the numerical studies provide insights into the selection of optimal edge-dependent synchronization gains when the initial conditions are assumed available."

When operating by themselves, it has been shown that these devices can provide individual benefits, maintaining some level of convenience, grid stability, and quality of life. However, a clean and sustainable energy future requires the coordinated control of these edge devices on a large scale with state-of-the art control and optimization theory innovation integrated with abundant sensor information. In this work, we take a step toward this vision by proposing a method to explore whether two different types of devices can coordinate to reach consensus on a global objective while continuing to provide their individual benefits. Due to their high impact on the grid and quality of life, this proof-of-concept work focuses on the optimal control of buildings and electric vehicle charging. It is shown that the novel algorithm, termed Network Lasso - Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers - Limited Communication Distributed Model Predictive Control (NALD), successfully achieves the global objective by tracking a power reference from the grid. Simultaneously, the peak electric vehicle charging load is minimized while fully charging each electric vehicle and the internal building temperature is regulated within specified temperature bounds. Results indicate that this can be achieved in the selected example consisting of three charging stations and one large office building."

There is a common consensus, that the size of impacting rain drops has a governing effect on the added damage. However, the literature lacks systematic experimental studies on the topic. In the present paper the effects of drop sizes in Rain Erosion Tests (RET) are studied for a commercial polyurethane based top coat applied to glass fiber-epoxy specimens. The tests are conducted applying a whirling arm RET at impact velocities ranging from 90 to 150 m/s and with four different rain field setups generating mean droplet diameters of 0.76 mm, 1.90 mm, 2.38 mm and 3.50 mm respectively. The time to damage at the end of incubation is determined by inspection of photographs captured inline at regular intervals through the test. Data sets of time to damage as function of local rotor velocity are extracted for each of the four different rain fields. From this data VQ curves (V for Velocity, Q for Quantity) are presented for different representations of quantity, namely specific impacts (DNV GL), specific impacts (ASTM) and accumulated impingement. The slope of the velocity-impingement (VH) curves vary with drop size. We propose a drop size dependent empirical model for impingement (H) to damage as function of impact velocity (v), H (v) = cv−m, where the scale parameter m and the shift parameter c are functions of the drop size. The drop size-dependent impingement model is then applied for computing the expected leading edge lifetime of a virtual 15 MW IEA reference turbine at 18 different meteorological stations in Northern Europe based on 10-min time series of rain intensity and wind speeds observed during several years. The drop size dependent model predicted on average 2.35 times longer lifetime compared to models based on the standard 2.38 mm drop size. Comparing the sites, the model shows a factor 3 variation of added damage per meter of accumulated rain between sites because of differences in concurrent wind during the rain events."

In the proposed method, each agent sends its state to a neighbor agent based on the edge-based event-triggering mechanism. We consider a consensus-based subgradient algorithm with a projection to the constraint set so that states of all agents asymptotically converge to an optimal solution. Simulation results confirm that the proposed event-triggered subgradient algorithm can effectively reduce the number of communications compared with the time-triggered algorithm."

However, existing studies only models communication interaction between agents as either fixed or switching topologies described by crisp graphs supported by algebraic graph theories. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to describing agent interactions using fuzzy graphs. Our approach is aimed at opening up new research avenues and defining new problems in coordination control especially in terms of dynamics between agents' states, graph topologies and coordination objectives. This paper studies distributed coordination on fuzzy graphs where the edge-weights modeling network topologies are dependent on the states of the agents in the network. In hindsight, the network weights are adjustable based on the situational state of the agents. First, we introduce the concept of fuzzy graphs and give some distinguishing features from the crisp or fixed graphs. Next, we provide some membership functions to define the state-dependent weights and finally we use some simulations to demonstrate the convergence of the proposed consensus algorithms especially for cases where the agents are subject to system failures."

Patient health data can be acquired locally from devices that can be used to make real-time decisions based on the data. For many years, several hospitals have deployed IoT in their patient rooms and their body parts. IoT devices could be vulnerable to hacking due to a lack of authentication and encryption policies, posing serious hazards to consumers. As a result, blockchain is useful for securing and proving transactions in the IoT. As a result, it is proposed that the problem be solved using Fog Computing (FGC), Edge Computing, and blockchain. Based on FGC technology, models of analysis, and a signature-encryption algorithm (SE), a three-tiered architecture is employed for the identification, verification, and identification of healthcare IoT devices. The generated findings are used to assess the suggested innovative SE algorithm. We discovered that FGC-based blockchain performed better for detecting malicious nodes in terms of packet error rate, reliability, and throughput when compared to cloud settings and other environments."

We use our bounds to formulate a convex optimization problem for time scale and edge weight selection. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the applicability of the derived H∞-norm bound expressions, and the optimization paradigm is illustrated via a formation control example involving non-homogeneous agents."
