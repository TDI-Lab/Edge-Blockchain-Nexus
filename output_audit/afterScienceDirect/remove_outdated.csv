Blockchain could provide a secure, low-cost mechanism to record and confirm operating and financial transactions along a decentralized system with no central authority. In addition to the smart grid, the Internet of Energy (IoE), which integrates many kinds of energies, has become a prominent innovation feature in the energy generation and distribution landscape. Given the establishing of a distributed smart grid infrastructure, it follows that IoE leverages the Internet to gather, control, optimize, and organize network energy information from various edge devices. Customers and suppliers use sensors and modern communication systems to collect the required data and forecast demand and supply. The present energy sector began changing towards distributed and decentralized approaches with smart grid energy utilities like electric vehicles, smart grid, and vehicle-to-grid technologies. The founding principles of blockchain, such as secrecy, decentralization, and transparency, have sparked an interest in the energy domain for this technology which provides automatic data interchange, complicated energy trades, improved service control, and distributed energy trading, among other things, by utilizing smart contracts. As decentralized renewable resources and smart grid networks are implemented and exploited, blockchain plays a critical role in developing the IoE market."

To improve the heat dissipation performance and the deployment flexibility of the edge data center, the concept of integrated indirect liquid cooling system for the edge data center server was introduced, and two samples were investigated through the tests. Firstly, the factors affecting the system performance were studied by experiment and numerical simulation. Then, the heat transfer performance, the flow characteristic, and the system's stability were analyzed. Finally, the temperature control ability of the air cooling and liquid cooling server was compared and analyzed by numerical simulation method. The results show that increasing the flow rate improves the heat dissipation performance when the surface temperature and thermal resistance of the chip reduce. But the further increase in flow rate slows down this trend. The heat dissipation performance of the system also reduces with the increase in coolant temperature. Two sets of the cooling systems, which are respectively arranged inside and outside the server, have similar flow characteristics, but the feasibility of the external system server is higher, which is verified by the numerical simulation method."
