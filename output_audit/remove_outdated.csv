Nonetheless, the current drone-based systems have some limitations, such as the need for humans in control of large-scale drones, drone's energy inefficiency, repercussion of quality of service (QoS) from abnormalities events, shortages of automaticity and real-time interactions, deficiency of swift decisions from artificial intelligence-based SAR, and underestimation of security issues in SAR systems. Therefore, developing a more advanced drone-based system is necessary to overcome these limitations. However, it is challenging to achieve the target due to trade-off relationships of technologies and strict requirements of time-critical SAR. This paper studies the feasibility of an Internet-of-Drones (IoD) system using blockchain and artificial intelligence at the edge to overcome limitations and improve SAR QoS. An advanced IoD system architecture from drones to a back-end system and end-users terminals has been proposed. Furthermore, advanced edge services and artificial intelligence at the edge have been presented for automatically searching for missing persons. In addition, computation offloading approaches have been provided to improve the energy efficiency of drones and reduce system latency. Last but not least, public and private blockchain, including Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, for providing secure and decentralized healthcare platform has been investigated and analyzed to enable real-time interaction between healthcare entities and improves healthcare services. The results show that the proposed system helps overcome the limitations and improve the SAR QoS. Besides, the proposed system satisfies the security requirements, including confidentiality, integrity, authentication, authorization, access control, privacy, trust, transparency, availability, automaticity, and tolerance. © 2022 The Author(s)"

To improve the heat dissipation performance and the deployment flexibility of the edge data center, the concept of integrated indirect liquid cooling system for the edge data center server was introduced, and two samples were investigated through the tests. Firstly, the factors affecting the system performance were studied by experiment and numerical simulation. Then, the heat transfer performance, the flow characteristic, and the system's stability were analyzed. Finally, the temperature control ability of the air cooling and liquid cooling server was compared and analyzed by numerical simulation method. The results show that increasing the flow rate improves the heat dissipation performance when the surface temperature and thermal resistance of the chip reduce. But the further increase in flow rate slows down this trend. The heat dissipation performance of the system also reduces with the increase in coolant temperature. Two sets of the cooling systems, which are respectively arranged inside and outside the server, have similar flow characteristics, but the feasibility of the external system server is higher, which is verified by the numerical simulation method. © 2022"

Therefore, a large amount of data is generated at the edge of the network and needs to be processed. However, no matter whether these computing tasks are offloaded to traditional central clusters or mobile edge computing (MEC) devices, the data is short of security and may be changed during transmission. In view of this challenge, this paper proposes a trusted task offloading optimization scheme that can offer low latency and high bandwidth services for IIoT with data security. Blockchain technology is adopted to ensure data consistency. Meanwhile, to reduce the impact of low throughput of blockchain on task offloading performance, we design the processes of consensus and offloading as a Markov decision process (MDP) by defining states, actions, and rewards. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is introduced to dynamically select offloading actions. To accelerate the optimization, we design a novel reward function for the DRL algorithm according to the scale and computational complexity of the task. Experiments demonstrate that compared with methods without optimization, our mechanism performs better when it comes to the number of task offloading and throughput of blockchain. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

However, conventional blockchain suffers from scalability issues due to its linear structure, which increases the storage overhead, and Intrusion detection performed was limited with attack severity, leading to performance degradation. To overcome these issues, we proposed MZWB (Multi-Zone-Wise Blockchain) model. Initially, all the authenticated IoT nodes in the network ensure their legitimacy by using the Enhanced Blowfish Algorithm (EBA), considering several metrics. Then, the legitimately considered nodes for network construction for managing the network using Bayesian-Direct Acyclic Graph (B-DAG), which considers several metrics. The intrusion detection is performed based on two tiers. In the first tier, a Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) analyzes the data packets by extracting packet flow features to classify the packets as normal, malicious, and suspicious. In the second tier, the suspicious packets are classified as normal or malicious using the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Finally, intrusion scenario performed reconstruction to reduce the severity of attacks in which Improved Monkey Optimization (IMO) is used for attack path discovery by considering several metrics, and the Graph cut utilized algorithm for attack scenario reconstruction (ASR). UNSW-NB15 and BoT-IoT utilized datasets for the MZWB method simulated using a Network simulator (NS-3.26). Compared with previous performance metrics such as energy consumption, storage overhead accuracy, response time, attack detection rate, precision, recall, and F-measure.

This vital function is thought to be supported by specialized neural mechanisms; however, although several face-selective regions have been identified in both humans and nonhuman primates, there is no consensus about which region(s) are involved in face detection. Here, we used naturally occurring errors of face detection (i.e. objects with illusory facial features referred to as examples of 'face pareidolia') to identify regions of the macaque brain implicated in face detection. Using whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging to test awake rhesus macaques, we discovered that a subset of face-selective patches in the inferior temporal cortex, on the lower lateral edge of the superior temporal sulcus, and the amygdala respond more to objects with illusory facial features than matched non-face objects. Multivariate analyses of the data revealed differences in the representation of illusory faces across the functionally defined regions of interest. These differences suggest that the cortical and subcortical face-selective regions contribute uniquely to the detection of facial features. We conclude that face detection is supported by a multiplexed system in the primate brain."

In order to solve this problem, we propose an IoT-enabled maritime transport communication system, which is a distributed system composed of base stations and offshore buoys, and uses the unique structure of the blockchain to solve the problems of security and reliability in the network. There are two main advantages: First, the decentralized network is reliable and can handle node failures. Second, the use of blockchain technology can integrate computing resources into the entire network to support different tasks, while taking into account information security and transaction security. On this basis, with the help of edge computing technology, we have also improved the energy efficiency and performance of IoT devices in the system."

This paradigm is relatively recent, and, together with cloud and fog computing, there may be some confusion about its meaning and implications. This paper aims to help practitioners and researchers better understand what the industry thinks about what IoT edge computing is, and the expected benefits and challenges associated with this paradigm. We conducted a survey using a semi-structured in-depth questionnaire to collect qualitative data from relevant stakeholders from 29 multinational companies and qualitatively analyzed these data using the Constructivist Grounded Theory (Charmaz) method. Several researchers participated in the coding process (collaborative coding). To ensure consensus on the constructs that support the theory and thus improve the rigor of qualitative research, we conducted an intercoder agreement analysis. From the analysis, we have derived a substantive and analytic theory of what companies perceive about IoT edge computing, its benefits and challenges. The theory is substantive in that the scope of validity refers to the 29 surveys processed and analytic in that it analyzes what is rather than explaining causality or attempting predictive generalizations. A public repository with all the data related to the information capture process and the products resulting from the analysis of this information is publicly available. This study aims to strengthen the evidence and support practitioners in making better informed decisions about why companies are adopting edge computing and the current challenges they face. Additionally, the testing theory phase shows that the results are aligned with the ISO/IEC TR 30164 standard."
